</div>

<p>It is probable that a good deal of the information
contained in this book will be new to the public; for
it has been collected under favour of exceptional
circumstances. But the reader will gain little if he
cannot contribute something on his side&mdash;if he cannot
share with the writer certain fundamental beliefs. The
first of these is that every nation has a spirit of its
own&mdash;a spirit which is the mainspring of national
action. It is more than a mechanical spring; for it
not only supplies a motive force, but determines the
moral character of the action which results. When we
read the history of nations, and especially the history
of their explorations, wars, and revolutions, we soon
recognise the spirit of each, and learn to expect its
appearance in every moment of crisis or endurance.
If it duly appears, our impression is confirmed; if it
fails on any occasion, we are disappointed. But the
disappointments are few&mdash;nations may at times surprise
us; but, as a rule, they are like themselves. Even when<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2">2</a></span>
they develop and seem to change, they are apt, under
the stress of action, to return to their aboriginal
character, and to exhibit it in their old historic fashion.
To attempt, then, to give an account of any national
struggle, without paying attention to the influence of
the characteristic spirit of the country or countries
concerned, would be a difficult undertaking, and a
mistaken one. Even in a short crisis, a great people
will probably display its historic colours, and in a long
one it certainly will. To ignore this, to describe national
actions without giving a sense of the animating spirit,
would be not only a tame and inadequate method; it
would lower the value of life itself by making mere
prose of what should, by right, partake of the nature
of poetry. History cannot often be entirely poetical,
or poetry entirely historical. When Homer told the
tale of Troy, he did not make prose&mdash;or even history&mdash;of
it. He everywhere infused into it ‘an incomparable
ardour’&mdash;he made an epic. But Mr. Thomas Hardy
wrote history in ‘The Dynasts,’ and made it an epic
too. An epic&mdash;the common definition tells us&mdash;is
‘a theme of action treated in heroic proportions and
style.’ ‘The Dynasts’ certainly is that&mdash;the struggle
is great, the issues are great, the men are great. Even
more than their heroic fighting, their speech and manners
in the moment of action are such as to show unfailingly
by what a distinctive and ever-present spirit national
life may be sustained and magnified.</p>

<p>When we come to nearer times, and more familiar
events, the same necessity is upon us. What writer of
artistic sense, or scientific honesty, would touch, for example,
the history of modern Egypt without attempting
to understand the character of such men as Gordon and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3">3</a></span>
Cromer, and the spirit which (however personal and
diverse in its manifestations) they both drew from the
nation that sent them forth? Such an understanding
would enable the narrator to carry us all with him.
For every man of our national birth and breeding
would feel, when he was told the story of such heroes,
not only their superiority but their likeness to himself.
‘There,’ he would say, ‘but for lack of fortune, or
opportunity, or courage, or stature, there goes John
Smith.’ It is admiration which helps us to feel that,
and a mean spirit which conceals it from us.</p>

<p>Further, it is my belief that the historian who would
deal adequately with our present War must have an
even wider understanding and sympathy. He must
have a broad enough view to recognise all the various
motives which impelled us, section by section, to enter
the struggle; and a deep enough insight to perceive
that, below all motives which can be expressed or debated
in words, there was an instinct&mdash;a spontaneous
emotion&mdash;which irresistibly stirred the majority of our
people, and made us a practically unanimous nation.
He must be able to see that this unanimity was no
freak&mdash;no sudden outburst&mdash;but the natural fulfilment
of a strong and long-trained national character; and
he must trace, with grateful admiration, the national
service contributed by many diverse classes, and by a
large number of distinguished men&mdash;the leaders and
patterns of the rest. However scientific the historian’s
judgments, and however restrained his style, it must be
impossible for any reader to miss the real point of
the narrative&mdash;the greatness of the free nations, and
the nobility of their heroes. Belgians, Serbians, French,
Italians, Americans&mdash;all must hear their great men<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4">4</a></span>
honoured, and their corporate virtues generously
recognised. We Britons, for our own part, must feel,
at every mention of the names of our champions, the
fine sting of the invisible fire with which true glory
burns the heart. It must never be possible to read, without
an uplifting of the spirit, the achievements of commanders
like Smith-Dorrien, Haig, and Birdwood&mdash;Plumer
and Rawlinson, Allenby and Byng, and Horne;
or the fate of Cradock and Kitchener; or the sea-fights
of Beatty and Sturdee, of Keyes and Tyrwhitt. It
must be clear, from the beginning to the end of the
vast record, that the British blood has equalled and
surpassed its ancient fame&mdash;that in every rank the old
virtues of courage, coolness, and endurance, of ordered
energy and human kindliness, have been, not the
occasional distinction, but the common characteristics
of our men. Look where you will on the scene of war,
you must be shown ‘a theme of action treated in
heroic proportions and style’&mdash;fit, at least, to indicate
the greatness of the national spirit.</p>

<p>In this book our concern is with the war at sea,
and with a part only of that gigantic effort. But of
this part, every word that has been said holds good.
The submarine and anti-submarine campaign is not a
series of minor operations. Its history is not a mere
episode among chapters of greater significance. On the
contrary, the fate of Britain, and the fate of Germany,
were speedily seen to be staked upon the issue of this
particular contest, as they have been staked upon no
other part of the world-wide struggle. The entrance
of America into the fellowship of nations was involved
in it. The future of civilisation depends upon it. Moreover,
in its course the British seaman has shown himself<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5">5</a></span>
possessed, in the highest degree, of the qualities by
which his forefathers conquered and kept our naval
predominance; and finally, it is in the submarine
war that we see most sharply the contrast of the spirit
of chivalry with the spirit of savagery; of the law of
humanity with the lawlessness of brute force; of the
possible redemption of social life with its irretrievable
degradation. It is a subject worthy, thrice over, of
treatment in a national epic.</p>

<p>The present book is not an epic&mdash;it is not a poetical
work at all. Half of it is mere technical detail; and
the rest plain fact plainly told. But it is far from my
intention that the sense of admiration for national
heroes, or the recognition of national greatness, shall
be absent from it. I have used few epithets; for they
seemed to me needless and inadequate. The stories
of the voyages and adventures of our own submarines,
and of the fighting of our men against the pirates, need
no heightening. They need only to be read and understood;
and it is chiefly with a view to their better
understanding, that the reader is offered a certain
amount of comment and description in the earlier
chapters. But a suggestion or two may be made here,
at the very beginning, in the hope of starting a train
of thought which may accompany the narrative with
a whisper of historic continuity&mdash;a reminder that as
with men, so with nations&mdash;none becomes utterly base
on a sudden, or utterly heroic. Their vices and their
virtues are the harvesting of their past.</p>

<p>Let us take a single virtue, like courage, which
is common to all nations but shows under a different
form or colour in each, and so becomes a national
characteristic, plainly visible in action. A historical<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6">6</a></span>
study of British courage would, I believe, show two
facts: first, that the peculiar quality of it has persisted
for centuries; and, secondly, that if our people have
changed at all in this respect, they have only changed
in the direction of greater uniformity. Once they
had two kinds of courage in war; now they have but
one, and that by far the better one. In the old days,
among the cool and determined captains of our race,
there were always a certain number of hot heads&mdash;‘men
of courage without discipline, of enthusiasm without
reason, of will without science.’ The best of them, like
Sir Richard Grenville, had the luck to die conspicuously,
in their great moments, and so to leave us an example
of the spirit that defies odds, and sets men above the
fear of death. The rest led their men into mad adventures,
where they perished to the injury of their
cause. Most Englishmen can understand the pure
joy of onset, the freedom of the moment when everything
has been given for the hope of winning one objective;
but it has been the more characteristic way
of our people&mdash;at any rate for the last five centuries&mdash;to
double courage with coolness, and fight not only
their hardest but their best. From Cressy to Waterloo,
and from Mons to Arras, we have won many battles
by standing steadily and shooting the attack to pieces.
Charges our men have made, but under discipline and
in the nick of opportunity. The Black Prince charged
fiercely at Poitiers; but it was only when he had
broken three attacks, and saw his chance to win. The
charge of the Worcesters at Gheluvelt, the charge of
the Oxfords at Nonneboschen, and a hundred more
like them, were as desperate as any ‘ride of death’;
but they were neither reckless nor useless, they were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7">7</a></span>
simply the heroic move to win the game. Still more
is this the rule at sea. Beatty at Jutland, like Nelson
and Collingwood at Trafalgar, played an opening in
which he personally risked annihilation; but nothing
was ever done with greater coolness, or more admirable
science. The perfect picture of all courage is, perhaps,
a great British war-ship in action; for there you have,
among a thousand men, one spirit of elation, of fearlessness,
of determination, backed by trained skill and
a self-forgetful desire to apply it in the critical moment.
The submarine, and the anti-submarine ship, trawler
or patrol-boat are, on a smaller scale, equally perfect
examples; for there is no hour of their cruise when
they are not within call of the critical moment. In
the trenches, in the air, in the fleet, you will see the
same steady skilful British courage almost universally
exemplified. But in the submarine war, the discipline
needed is even more absolute, the skill even more
delicate, the ardour even more continuous and self-forgetful;
and all these demands are even more completely
fulfilled.</p>

<p>This is fortunate, and doubly fortunate; for the
submarine war has proved to be the main battlefield
of our spiritual crusade, as well as a vital military
campaign. The men engaged in it have been marked
out by fate, as our champions in the contest of ideals.
They are the patterns and defenders of human nature in
war, against those who preach and practise barbarism.
Here&mdash;and nowhere else so clearly as here&mdash;the world
has seen the death struggle between the two spirits
now contending for the future of mankind. Between
the old chivalry, and the new savagery, there can be
no more truce; one of the two must go under, and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8">8</a></span>
barbarians knew it when they cried <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Weltmacht oder
Niedergang</i>. Of the spirit of the German nation it
is not necessary to say much. Everything that could
be charged against them has been already proved, by
their own words and actions. They have sunk without
warning women and children, doctors and nurses,
neutrals and wounded men, not by tens or hundreds
but by thousands. They have publicly rejoiced over
these murders with medals and flags, with songs and
school holidays. They have not only broken the rules
of international law; they have with unparalleled
cruelty, after sinking even neutral ships, shot and
drowned the crews in open boats, that they might
leave no trace of their crimes. The men who have
done&mdash;and are still doing&mdash;these things have courage
of a kind. They face danger and hardship to a certain
point, though, by their own account, in the last extreme
they fail to show the dignity and sanity with which
our own men meet death. But their peculiar defect
is not one of nerve, but of spirit. They lack that
instinct which, with all civilised races, intervenes, even
in the most violent moment of conflict or desperation,
and reminds the combatant that there are blows which
it is not lawful to strike in any circumstances whatever.
This instinct&mdash;the religion of all chivalrous peoples&mdash;is
connected by some with humanity, by some with
courtesy, by ourselves with sport. In this matter
we are all in the right. The savage in conflict thinks
of nothing but his own violent will; the civilised and
the chivalrous are always conscious of the fact that
there are other rights in the world beside their own.
The humane man forbears his enemy; the courteous
man respects him, as one with rights like his own; the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9">9</a></span>
man with the instinct of sport knows that he must
not snatch success by destroying the very game itself.
The civilised nation will not hack its way to victory
through the ruins of human life. It will be restrained,
if by no other consideration, yet at least by the recollection
that it is but one member of a human fellowship,
and that the greatness of a part can never be
achieved by the corruption of the whole.</p>

<p>The German nature is not only devoid of this
instinct, it is roused to fury by the thought of it. Any
act, however cruel and barbarous, if only it tends
to defeat the enemies of Germany, is a good deed, a
brave act, and to be commended. The German general
who lays this down is supported by the German professor
who adds: ‘The spontaneous and elementary
hatred towards England is rooted in the deepest depths
of our own being&mdash;there, where considerations of reason
do not count, where the irrational, the instinct, alone
dominates. We hate in the English the hostile principle
of our innermost and highest nature. And it is well
that we are fully aware of this, because we touch
therein the vital meaning of this War.’ Before the
end comes, the barbarian will find this hostile principle,
and will hate it, in the French, the Italians, the Americans&mdash;in
the whole fellowship of nations against which
he is fighting with savage fury. But, to our satisfaction,
he has singled us out first; for, when we hear him, we
too are conscious of a spontaneous hatred in the depths
of our being; and we see that in this we do ‘touch the
vital meaning of this War.’</p>

<span class="subhead">THE EVOLUTION OF THE SUBMARINE</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Many are the fables which the Germans have done
their best to pass off for truth among the spectators
of the present War; but not one is more wilfully and
demonstrably false, than their account of the origin
of the submarine. According to the story which they
have endeavoured to spread among the unthinking
public in neutral countries, the under-sea boat&mdash;the
arm with which they claim to have revolutionised
naval warfare&mdash;is the product of German ingenuity
and skill. The French, they say, had merely played
with the idea; their submarines were costly toys,
dangerous only to those who tried to navigate
them. The Americans had shown some promise half
a century ago; but having since become a pacifist
race of dollar-hunters, they had lost interest in war,
and their boats would be found useless in practice.
As for the British, the day of their naval power was
past; they had spent their time and money upon the
mania for big ships, and neglected the more scientific
vessel, the submarine, which had made the big ships
obsolete in a single year’s campaign. The ship of the
future, the U-boat, was the national weapon of
Germany alone.</p>

<p>The claim was unjustified; but, so far, it was not&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11">11</a></span>to
an uninstructed neutral&mdash;obviously unjustified. The
Americans were not yet at war; the submarines of
France and Britain were hardly ever heard of. Our
boats had few targets, and their operations were still
further restricted by the rules of international law,
which we continued to keep, though our enemies did
not. Moreover, whatever our Service did achieve
was done secretly; and even our successes were
announced so briefly and vaguely as to make no impression.
The result was that the Germans were able
to make out a plausible title to the ‘command of the
sea beneath the surface’; and they even gained a
hearing for the other half of their claim, which was
unsupported by any evidence whatever. The submarine
is not, in its origin, of German invention;
the idea of submarine war was not a German idea,
nor have Germans contributed anything of value to
the long process of experiment and development by
which the idea has been made to issue in practical
under-water navigation. From beginning to end, the
Germans have played their characteristic part. They
have been behind their rivals in intelligence; they
have relied on imitation of the work of others; on
discoveries methodically borrowed and adapted; and
when they have had to trust to their own abilities, they
have never passed beyond mediocrity. They have
shown originality in one direction only&mdash;their ruthless
disregard of law and humanity. These statements
are not the outcome of partisanship, but of a frank
study of the facts. They are clearly proved by the
history of submarine war.</p>

<p>That history may be said to begin with the second
half of the sixteenth century, when the two main<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12">12</a></span>
principles or aims of submarine war were first set forth&mdash;both
by English seamen. Happily the records remain.
Sir William Monson, one of Queen Elizabeth’s admirals,
in his famous ‘Naval Tracts,’ suggests that a powerful
ship may be sunk much more easily by an under-water
shot than by ordinary gunfire. His plan is ‘to place
a cannon in the hold of a bark, with her mouth to the
side of the ship: the bark shall board, and then to give
fire to the cannon that is stowed under water, and
they shall both instantly sink: the man that shall
execute this stratagem may escape in a small boat
hauled the other side of the bark.’</p>

<p>This is the germinal idea from which sprang the
submarine mine or torpedo; and the first design for
a submarine boat was also produced by the English
Navy in the same generation. The author of this was
William Bourne, who had served as a gunner under
Sir William Monson. His invention is described in
his book of ‘Inventions or Devices’ published in
1578, and is remarkable for its proposed method of
solving the problem of submersion. This is to be
achieved by means of two side-tanks, into which water
can be admitted through perforations, and from which
it can be blown out again by forcing the inner side
of each tank outwards. These false sides are made
tight with leather suckers, and moved by winding
hand-screws&mdash;a crude and inefficient mechanism, but
a proof that the problem had been correctly grasped.
For a really practical solution of this, and the many
other difficulties involved in submarine navigation,
the resources of applied science were then hopelessly
inadequate. It was not until after more than three
hundred years of experiment that inventors were in a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13">13</a></span>
position to command a mechanism that would carry
out their ideas effectively.</p>

<p>The record of these three centuries of experiment is
full of interest; for it shows us a long succession of
courageous men taking up, one after another, the same
group of scientific problems and bringing them, in
spite of all dangers and disasters, gradually nearer
to a final solution. Many nations contributed to
the work, but especially the British, the American,
the Dutch, the French, the Spanish, the Swedish, the
Russian, and the Italian. The part played by each
of them has been, on the whole, characteristic. The
British were the first, as practical seamen, to put
forward the original idea, gained from the experience
of their rivalry with Spain. They have also succeeded,
at the end of the experimental period, in making the
best combined use of the results of the long collaboration.
A Dutchman built the first practical submarine,
and achieved the first successful dive. The Americans
have made the greatest number of inventions, and of
daring experiments in earlier wars. The French have
shown, as a nation, the strongest interest in the idea,
and their navy was effectively armed with submarines
ten years before that of any other Power. To them,
to the Dutch, and to the Italians, the credit belongs
of that indispensable invention, the optic tube or
periscope. The Swedes and Russians have the great
names of Nordenfelt and Drzewiecki to their credit.
The Germans alone, among the eight or nine nations
interested in the science of naval war, have from first
to last contributed almost nothing to the evolution
of the submarine. The roll of submarine inventors
includes about 175 names, of which no less than 60<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14">14</a></span>
belong to the English-speaking peoples, but only six
to Germany. Among these six, the name of Bauer
is remembered as that of a courageous experimenter,
persevering through a career of repeated failures; but
neither he, nor any of his fellow countrymen, advanced
the common cause by the suggestion of a single idea
of value. Finally, when the German Admiralty, after
the failure of their own Howaldt boat, decided to
borrow the Holland type from America, it was no
German, but the Franco-Spanish engineer d’Equevilley,
who designed for them the first five U-boats, of which
all the later ones are modifications. The English
Admiralty were in no such straits. They were only
one year before the Germans in adopting the Holland
type; but the native genius at their disposal has
enabled them to keep ahead of their rivals from that
day to this, in the design, efficiency, size, and number
of their submarine vessels. And this result is exactly
what might have been expected from the history of
submarine invention.</p>

<p>The construction of a workable submarine depends
upon the discovery and solution of a number of problems,
the first five of which may be said to be the problems
<span class="locked">of&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="in0 in4">
1.  Submersion.<br />
2.  Stability.<br />
3.  Habitability.<br />
4.  Propulsion and Speed.<br />
5.  Offensive Action.
</p>

<p>If we take these in order, and trace the steps by which
the final solution was approached, we shall be able to
confirm what has been said about the work contributed
by successive inventors.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15">15</a></span>
1. <i>Submersion.</i>&mdash;We have seen that for submersion
and return to the surface, Bourne had at the very
beginning devised the side-tank to which water could
be admitted, and from which it could be ‘blown out’
at will. Bushnell, a remarkable inventor of British-American
birth, substituted a hand-pump in his boat
of 1771, for the mechanism proposed by Bourne. In
1795, Armand-Maizière, a Frenchman, designed a steam
submarine vessel to be worked by ‘a number of oars
vibrating on the principle of a bird’s wing.’ Of these
‘wings,’ one lot were intended to make the boat submerge.
Nothing came of this proposal, and for more
than a century tanks and pumps remained the sole
means of submersion. In 1893 Haydon, an American,
invented a submarine for the peaceful purpose of
exploring the ocean bed. Its most important feature
was the method of submersion. This was accomplished
by means of an interior cylindrical tank, with direct
access to the sea, and fitted with two powerfully geared
pistons. By simply drawing the pistons in, or pushing
them out, the amount of water ballast could be nicely
regulated, and the necessity for compressed air or other
expellants was avoided. This device would have given
great satisfaction to William Bourne, the Elizabethan
gunner, whose original idea, after more than two
centuries, it carried out successfully. Finally, in 1900,
the American inventor, Simon Lake, in his <i>Argonaut II.</i>,
introduced a new method of diving. For the reduction
of the vessel’s floatability he employed the usual tanks;
but for ‘travelling’ between the surface and the
bottom, he made use of ‘four big hydroplanes, two
on each side, that steer the boat either down or up.’
Similar hydroplanes, or horizontal rudders, appeared<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16">16</a></span>
in the later Holland boats, and are now in common
use in all submarine types.</p>

<p>Lake was of British descent, his family having
emigrated from Wales to New Jersey; but he owed
his first interest in submarine construction, and many
of his inventive ideas, to the brilliant French writer,
Jules Verne, whose book ‘Twenty Thousand Leagues
under the Sea’ came by chance into his hands when
he was a boy ten years old, and made a lasting impression
upon him.</p>

<p>2. <i>Stability.</i>&mdash;Next to the power of submersion, the
most necessary quality in a submarine is that of stability
under water. The most obvious method of securing this
is by water ballast, which was probably the first means
actually employed. Bushnell, in 1771, substituted
a heavy weight of lead, as being more economical of
space and better suited to the shape of his boat, which
resembled a turtle in an upright position. The leaden
ballast, being detachable at will, also acted as a safety
weight, to be dropped at a moment of extreme urgency.
In the <i>Nautilus</i>, built in 1800 by the famous engineer,
Robert Fulton, an American of English birth and
education, the leaden weight reappeared as a keel,
and was entirely effective. The inventor, in a trial at
Brest in 1801, dived to a depth of 25 feet, and performed
successful evolutions in different directions for over an
hour. Bauer, fifty years later, returned to the ballast
principle, and used both a water-tank and a safety
weight in the same boat. The results were disastrous.
His first submarine sank at her first trial in Kiel harbour,
and was never refloated. His second was built in
England; but this, too, sank, with great loss of life. His
third, <i>Le Diable Marin</i>, after several favourable trials<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17">17</a></span>
at Cronstadt, fouled her propeller in a bed of seaweed,
and the releasing of the safety weights only resulted
in bringing her bows to the surface. The crew escaped
with difficulty, and the vessel then sank.</p>

<p>Three years later, in 1861, Olivier Riou designed
two boats, in both of which stability was to be preserved
automatically by the device of a double hull. The
two cylinders which composed it, one within the other,
were not fixed immovably to one another, but were
on rollers, so that if the outer hull rolled to the right
the inner rolled to the left. By this counterbalancing
effect, it was estimated that the stability of the vessel
would be absolutely secured; but nothing is recorded
of the trials of these boats. The celebrated French
inventors, Bourgois and Brun, reintroduced the principle
of water-tanks combined with a heavy iron ballast
keel. But in 1881, the Rev. W. Garrett, the English
designer of the Nordenfelt boats, invented a new
automatic mechanism for ensuring stability. This
consisted of two vertical rudders with a heavy pendulum
weight so attached to them that, if the boat dipped out
of the horizontal, the pendulum swung down and gave
the rudders an opposite slant which raised the vessel
again to a horizontal position. This arrangement,
though perfect in theory, in practice developed fatal
defects, and subsequent types have all returned to the
use of water-tanks, made to compensate, by elaborate
but trustworthy mechanism, for every loss or addition
of weight.</p>

<p>3. <i>Habitability.</i>&mdash;For the habitability of a submarine
the prime necessity is a supply of air capable
of supporting life during the period of submersion.
The first actual constructor of a submarine, Cornelius<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18">18</a></span>
van Drebbel, of Alkmaar, in Holland, was fully aware
of this problem, and claimed to have solved it, not by
mechanical but by chemical means. His improved
boat, built in England about 1622, carried twelve
rowers, besides passengers, among whom King James I.
is said to have been included on one occasion, and was
successfully navigated for several hours at a depth of
ten to fifteen feet. ‘Drebbel conceived,’ says Robert
Boyle, in 1662, ‘that ’tis not the whole body of the air,
but a certain Quintessence (as Chymists speake) or
spirituous part of it that makes it fit for respiration,
which being spent, the grosser body or carcase (if
I may so call it) of the Air, is unable to cherish the vital
flame residing in the heart: so that (for aught I could
gather) besides the Mechanical contrivance of his
vessel he had a Chymical liquor, which he accounted
the chief secret of his Submarine Navigation. For
when from time to time, he perceived that the finer
and purer part of the Air was consumed or over-clogged
by the respiration and steames of those that went in
his ship, he would, by unstopping a vessel full of the
liquor, speedily restore to the troubled air such a
proportion of vital parts as would make it again for a
good while fit for Respiration.’</p>

<p>Drebbel, who was a really scientific man, may
possibly have discovered this chemical secret. If
so, he anticipated by more than 200 years a very important
device now in use in all submarines, and in
any case he was the originator of the idea. But his
son-in-law, a German named Kuffler, who attempted
after Drebbel’s death to exploit his submarine inventions,
was a man of inferior ability, and either
ignorant of the secret or incapable of utilising it. For<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19">19</a></span>
another century and a half, submarine designers contented
themselves with the small supply of air which
was carried down at the time of submersion. Even
the <i>Turtle</i>&mdash;Bushnell’s boat of 1776, which has been
described as ‘the first submarine craft which really
navigated under serious conditions’&mdash;was only built
to hold one man with a sufficient supply of air for
half an hour’s submersion. This was a bare minimum
of habitability, and Fulton, twenty-five years later,
found it necessary to equip his <i>Nautilus</i> with a compressed
air apparatus. Even with this, the crew of
two could only be supplied for one hour. In 1827,
the very able French designer, Castera, took out a
patent for a submarine life-boat, to which air was to
be supplied by a tube from the surface, protected by
a float, from which the whole vessel was suspended.
The danger here was from the possible entry of water
through the funnel, and the boat, though planned with
great ingenuity, was never actually tried. Bauer, in
1855, fitted his <i>Diable Marin</i> with large water-tubes,
running for thirty feet along the top of the boat and
pierced with small holes from which, when desired,
a continual rain could be made to fall. This shower-bath
had a purifying effect on the vitiated air, but it
had obvious disadvantages; and there is no record
of its having been put into actual use before the unfortunate
vessel sank, as before related. In the same
year, a better principle was introduced by Babbage,
an English inventor, who designed a naval diving-bell,
fitted with three cylinders of compressed air. His
method was followed by Bourgois and Brun, whose boats
of 1863&ndash;5 carried steel reservoirs with compressed
air, at a pressure of at least 15 atmospheres. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20">20</a></span>
principle was now established, and was adopted in
Holland and Lake boats, and in all subsequent
types, with the addition of chemical treatment of the
vitiated air.</p>

<p>4. <i>Propulsion.</i>&mdash;The various solutions of this problem
have naturally followed the successive steps in
the development of machinery. Drebbel made use of
oars. Bushnell, though he speaks of ‘an oar,’ goes
on to describe it as ‘formed upon the principle of the
screw&mdash;its axis entered the vessel, and being turned one
way rowed the vessel forward, but being turned the
other way rowed it backward: it was made to be
turned by the hand or foot.’ Moreover, he had a
similar ‘oar’ placed at the top of the vessel, which
helped it to ascend or descend in the water. The conclusion
seems unavoidable that to this designer belongs
the honour of having invented the screw propeller,
and also of having put it into successful operation.
Fulton adopted the same method of propeller and
hand-winch in his <i>Nautilus</i>; but his huge vessel, the
<i>Mute</i>, built in 1814 to carry 100 men, was driven by
a silent steam-engine. He died during the trials of
this boat, and further experiment with it seems to
have been abandoned, possibly owing to the great
interest excited by his first war steamer, which was
building at the same time. A regrettable set-back
was thus caused. For forty years no one experimented
with any kind of propulsory engine. Bauer, in 1855,
could devise no better method of working his propeller
than a system of 7-foot wheels, turned by a pair of men
running on a treadmill. At the same moment, however,
a more fruitful genius was at work. A French
professor, Marié-Davy, designed a submarine in which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21">21</a></span>
the propeller was driven by an electro-magnetic engine
placed in the stern of the ship, with batteries forward.
The idea was a valuable one, with a great future before
it, though for the moment it achieved no visible
success. A year later, in 1855, the famous British
engineer, James Nasmyth, designed a ‘submerged
mortar,’ which was in reality a ram of great weight
and thickness, capable of being submerged level with
the surface, and driven at a speed of over 10 knots
by a steam-engine with a single high-pressure boiler.
But in spite of the simplicity and power of this boat,
it was finally rejected as being neither invisible nor
invulnerable to an armed enemy; and in their desire
to obtain complete submersion, the French inventors
of the next few years&mdash;Hubault, Conseil, and Masson&mdash;all
returned to the hand-winch method of propulsion.
Riou, however, in 1861, adopted steam for one of his
boats, and electric power for the other; and in 1883
the American engineer, Alstitt, built the first submarine
fitted with both steam and electricity. Steam was
also used in the <i>Plongeur</i> of Bourgois and Brun, which
was completed in the same year.</p>

<p>The American Civil War then gave a great opportunity
for practical experiments in torpedo attack;
but the difficulty of wholly submerged navigation not
having been yet solved, the boats used were not true
submarines, but submersibles. Their propulsion was
by steam, and their dimensions small. A more
ambitious invention was put forward in 1869 by a
German, Otto Vogel, whose design was accepted by
the Prussian Government. His submersible steamship
was to be heavily armed, and was ‘considered the
equal of a first-class iron-clad in defensive and offensive<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22">22</a></span>
powers.’ These powers, however, never came into
operation.</p>

<p>Inventors now returned to the designing of true
submarines; and after the Frenchman, Constantin, the
American, Halstead, and the Russian, Drzewiecki,
had all made the best use they could of the hand-winch
or the pedal for propulsion, three very interesting
attempts were made in 1877&ndash;8 to secure a more satisfactory
engine. Olivier’s boat, patented in May 1877&ndash;8,
was to be propelled by the gases generated from the
ignition of high explosives, the massed vapours escaping
through a tube at the stern. This ingenious method
was, however, too dangerous for practical use. Surman’s
design of 1878 included a propeller, rotated by compressed
air. But the English boat of the same date,
Garrett’s <i>Resurgam</i>, was much the most noteworthy of
the three, and introduced a method which may in the
future be brought to perfection with great results. In
this boat, the motive force was steam, and propulsion
under water, as well as on the surface, was aimed at
and actually attained. In her trials, the vessel showed
herself capable of navigating under water for a distance
of 12 miles, by getting up a full head of steam in a very
powerful boiler, with the aid of a blower, before diving;
then by shutting the fire-door and chimney, and utilising
the latent heat as long as it would last. When the heat
was exhausted, it was, of course, necessary to return
to the surface, slow up the fire again and recharge the
boiler with water. The vessel was remarkably successful,
and had the great merit of showing no track whatever
when moving under water. She was lost by an
accident, but not until she had impressed Nordenfelt,
the Swedish inventor, so strongly that he secured the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23">23</a></span>
services of her designer, Garrett, for the building of
his own submarine boats. The first of these appeared
in 1881.</p>

<p>In the same year were patented Woodhouse’s
submarine, driven by compressed air, and Génoud’s,
with a gas-engine worked by hydrogen, which is said
to have attained a speed of between four and five knots.
Blakesley, in 1884, proposed to use steam raised in a
fireless boiler heated by a chemical composition. In 1884,
too, Drzewiecki produced the fourth of his ingenious
little boats, driven this time not by pedals but by an
electric motor. His example was followed by Tuck of
San Francisco shortly afterwards, and by Campbell
and Ash in their <i>Nautilus</i>, which in 1886 underwent
very successful trials in the West Indian Docks at
Tilbury, near London. In 1886 D’Allest, the celebrated
French engineer, designed a submarine fitted with a
petrol combustion engine. But the question of propulsion
may be said to have been finally settled, within
a few months after this, in favour of the electro-motor.
For Gustave Zédé’s famous <i>Gymnote</i>, which was actually
put on the stocks in April 1887, attained in practice a
surface speed of 10 knots, and a maximum of 7 to
8 under water. This success saved future designers
the trouble of further experiments with ingenious
futilities.</p>

<p>5. <i>Offensive Action.</i>&mdash;We have so far been considering
the development of the submarine as a vessel navigable
under water, without reference to the purpose of offence
in war. But this purpose was from the first in view;
and with almost all the inventors recorded, it formed
the main incentive of their efforts. The evolution of
the submarine weapon has been much simpler, and more<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24">24</a></span>
regular, than that of the vessel which was to use it;
but it has been equally wonderful, and the history of
it is equally instructive. Briefly, the French, in this
department as in the other, have shown the most
imaginative enthusiasm, the Americans the greatest
determination to achieve results&mdash;even with crude or
dangerous means&mdash;while the English have to their
credit both the earliest attempts in actual war, and the
final achievement of the automobile torpedo. Of the
Germans, as before, we must record that they have
contributed nothing of any scientific value.</p>

<p>Sir William Monson’s device of a bark, with an
under-water cannon and an accompanying boat was
soon developed by the English navy into the more
practicable mine, self-contained and floating, to be
towed by boat or submarine. In January, 1626, the
King gave a warrant to the Master of the Ordnance,
‘for the making of divers water-mines, water-petards,
and boates to goe under water.’ In June of the same
year, the Duke of Buckingham, then commanding
the naval expedition for the relief of La Rochelle, issued
a warrant ‘for the delivery of 50 water-mynes, 290 water-petards,
and 2 boates to conduct them under water.’
Pepys in his ‘Diary’ for March 14, 1662, mentions
a proposal by Kuffler of an ‘engine to blow up ships.’
He adds, ‘We doubted not the matter of fact, it being
tried in Cromwell’s time, but the safety of carrying
them in ships;’ and probably this distrust of Drebbel’s
German subordinate proved to be justified, for nothing
more is heard of the design. The attempt referred to
as made ‘in Cromwell’s time’ may have been Prince
Rupert’s attack on Blake’s flagship, the <i>Leopard</i>, in
1650. The engine then used was not a submarine one<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25">25</a></span>
but an infernal machine, concealed in an oil-barrel,
brought alongside in a shore boat by men disguised
as Portuguese, and intended to be hoisted on board the
ship and then fired by a trigger and string. A more
ingenious ‘ship-destroying engine’ was devised by the
Marquess of Worcester in 1655. This was evidently
a clock-machine, for it might be affixed to a ship either
inside, by stealth, or outside by a diver, ‘and at an
appointed minute, though a week after, either day or
night, it shall infallibly sink that ship.’</p>

<p>The clock machine was actually first tried in action
in 1776 by Bushnell, or rather by Sergeant Lee, whom
he employed to work his <i>Turtle</i> for him. The attack
by this submarine upon the <i>Eagle</i>, a British 64-gun
ship lying in the Hudson River, was very nearly successful.
The <i>Turtle</i> reached the enemy’s stern unobserved,
carrying a mine or magazine of 150 lbs. of powder,
and provided with a detachable wood-screw which was
to be turned until it bit firmly on the ship’s side. The
mine was then to be attached to it, and the clockwork
set going. The wood-screw, however, bit upon some iron
fittings instead of wood, and failed to hold; the tide
also was too strong for Lee, who had to work the wood-screw
and the propeller at the same time. He came
to the surface, was chased by a guard-boat, and dived
again, abandoning his torpedo, which drifted and blew
up harmlessly when the clockwork ran down. Lee
escaped, but the <i>Turtle</i> was soon afterwards caught and
sunk by the British. Bushnell himself, in the following
year, attacked the <i>Cerberus</i> with a ‘machine’
consisting of a trigger-mine towed by a whale-boat.
He was detected, and his mine captured by a British
schooner, the crew of which, after hauling the machine<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26">26</a></span>
on deck, accidentally exploded it themselves, three
out of the four of them being killed.</p>

<p>In 1802 Fulton’s <i>Nautilus</i>, in her trials at Brest,
succeeded in blowing up a large boat in the harbour.
In 1814 his submersible, the <i>Mute</i>, was armed with
‘columbiads,’ or immensely strong under-water guns,
which had previously been tried with success on an old
hulk. Similar guns were tried nearly fifty years later
by the Spanish submarine designer Monturiol. But the
offensive weapon of the period was the mine, and the
ingenuity of inventors was chiefly directed to methods
of affixing it to the side or bottom of the ship to be
destroyed. One of these was the use of long gloves
of leather or rubber, protruding from the interior of
the submarine, invented by Castera in 1827, and adopted
by Bauer, Drzewiecki, and Garrett in succession. But
the device was both unhandy and dangerous; there
would often be great difficulty in manœuvring the
boat into a position in which the gloves would be available,
and they could not be made thick enough to
withstand the pressure of any depth of water. Practical
military instinct demanded a method of launching the
mine or torpedo against the target, and the first attempts
were made by placing a trigger-mine at the end of a spar
carried by the nose of the attacking boat. In October,
1863, during the American Civil War, the forts of
Charleston were in danger from the accurate fire of
the Federal battleship <i>Ironsides</i>, and Lieut. Glassell
was ordered to attack her in the submarine <i>David</i>.
He had no difficulty in getting near his enemy and
exploding his torpedo, but he had misjudged his distance,
and only succeeded in deluging the <i>Ironsides</i> with a
column of water. The submarine was herself severely<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27">27</a></span>
injured by the explosion and had to be abandoned. A
second <i>David</i>, commanded by Lieut. Dixon, in February,
1864, attacked the <i>Housatonic</i>, off the same harbour,
and in spite of the greatest vigilance on the part of
Admiral Dahlgren’s officers, succeeded in reaching the
side of the battleship, where she lay for the space of a
minute making sure of her contact. The mine was then
fired: the <i>Housatonic</i> rose on a great wave, listed
heavily, and sank at once. The <i>David</i>, too, disappeared,
and it was found three years afterwards that she had
been irresistibly sucked into the hole made in her
enemy’s side. After this, experiments were made with
drifting and towing mines, and with buoyant mines
to be released at a depth below the enemy’s keel; but
by 1868 the invention of the automobile torpedo by
the English engineer, Whitehead, of Fiume, solved the
problem of the submarine offensive in the most sudden
and conclusive manner.</p>

<p><i>The Torpedo.</i>&mdash;Whitehead’s success arose out of
the failure of an enterprising Austrian officer, Captain
Lupuis, who had been trying to steer a small fireship
along the surface of the water by means of ropes from
a fixed base either on shore or in a parent ship. The
plan was a crude one and was rejected by the Austrian
naval authorities; it was then entrusted to Whitehead,
who found it incapable of any practical realisation.
He was, however, impressed with Lupuis’ belief in the
value of a weapon which could be operated from a
distance, and though he failed in designing a controllable
vessel, he conceived the idea of an automobile
torpedo, and, after two years’ work, constructed it in
a practical form. It has been spoken of as ‘the only
invention that was perfect when devised,’ and it certainly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28">28</a></span>
came very near perfection at the first attempt, but
it was erratic and could not be made to keep its depth.
In 1868, however, Whitehead invented the ‘balance-chamber,’
which remedied these defects, and brought
two finished torpedoes to England for trial. They were
fired by compressed air from a submerged tube, and
at once proved capable of averaging 7½ to 8½ knots
up to 600 yards and of striking a ship under way up
to 200 yards. The target, an old corvette in the Medway,
was sunk on to the mud by the first shot, at 136
yards, and immediately after the trials the British
Government bought the secret, and other rights.
Imitations were, of course, soon attempted in other
countries, and a type, called the Schwartzkopf, was
for some years manufactured in Berlin and used in the
German and Spanish navies; it was also tried by the
Italians and Japanese, but it failed in the end to hold
its own against the Whitehead.</p>

<p>The automobile torpedo was at first used only for
the armament of ordinary war-ships; it was not until
1879 that an American engineer named Mortensen
designed a submarine with a torpedo-tube in the bows.
His example was followed by Berkeley and Hotchkiss
in 1880, by Garrett in his first Nordenfelt boat of 1881,
and by Woodhouse and by Lagane in the same year.
Even after this Drzewiecki, Tuck, and D’Allest designed
their submarines without torpedo-tubes, but they were,
in fact, indispensable, and the use of the Whitehead
torpedo has been for the last twenty years assumed
as the main function of all submarines designed for war.</p>

<p><i>The Submarine in War.</i>&mdash;The difficulties of construction,
propulsion, and armament having now been
solved, the submarine at last took its place among the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29">29</a></span>
types of war-ships in the annual lists. From the first
England and France held a marked lead, and in Brassey’s
Naval Annual for 1914 the submarine forces of the
chief naval Powers were given as follows:&mdash;Great
Britain, 76 vessels built and 20 ordered; France, 70 and
23; the U.S.A., 29 and 31; Germany, 27 and 12. The
technical progress of the four services was probably
more equal than their merely numerical strength;
but it was not altogether equal, as may be seen by a
brief comparison of the development of the British
and German submarine types between 1904 and 1914.
The eight British A-boats of 1904 had a displacement
of 180 tons on surface/207 tons submerged; the German U1 of 1904&ndash;6
was slightly larger (197/236) but in every other respect
inferior&mdash;its horse-power was only 250 on surface/100 submerged, as
against 550/150, its surface speed only 10 knots against 11·5,
and it was fitted with only a single torpedo-tube instead
of the A-boat’s two. This last deficiency was remedied
in 1906&ndash;8, but the German displacement did not rise
above 210/250 nor the horse-power above 400/150, while the
British advanced to 550/660 and 1200/550. By 1913 the
Germans were building boats of 650/750 displacement and
1400/500 horse-power, but the British were still ahead with
725/810 and 1750/600, and had also a superiority in speed of
16/10 knots to 14/8. The last German boats of which any
details have been published are those of 1913&ndash;14,
with a displacement of about 800 tons on the surface
and a maximum speed of 18/7 knots. The British
F-boats of the same date are in every way superior
to these, with a displacement of 940/1200, a speed of 20/12<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30">30</a></span>
knots, and an armament of six torpedo-tubes against
the German four. The comparison cannot be carried,
in figures, beyond the date of the outbreak of war,
but it is well known among the allies of Great Britain
that the superiority has been amply maintained, and,
in certain important respects, materially increased.</p>

<p>The four years of conflict have, however, afforded
an opportunity for a further, and even more important,
comparison. The problems of submarine war are not
all material problems: moral qualities are needed to
secure the efficient working of machinery, the handling
of the ship under conditions of danger and difficulty
hitherto unknown in war, and the conduct of a campaign
with new legal and moral aspects of its own. In two
of these departments, those of efficiency and seamanship,
the Germans have achieved a considerable show
of success, though it could be, and in time will be,
easily shown that the British naval service has been
more successful still. But in the domain of policy and
of international morality, the comparison becomes no
longer a comparison but a contrast; the new problems
have been dealt with by the British in accordance with
the old principles of law and humanity; by the Germans
they have not been solved at all, the knot has simply
been cut by the cruel steel of the pirate and the
murderer. The methods of the U-boat campaign have
not only brought successive defeats upon Germany,
they will in the end cripple her commerce for many
years; and, in addition to her material losses, she will
suffer the bitter consequences of moral outlawry.</p>

<p>Of the general efficiency of the German submarines
it is too soon to speak, but it may be readily admitted
that they have done well. We know, of course, many<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31">31</a></span>
cases of failure&mdash;cases in which boats have been lost
by defects in their engines, by running aground through
mishandling in shoal waters, or by inability to free themselves
from British nets. On the other hand, the German
patrol has been kept up with a degree of continuity
which, when we remember the dislocation caused by
their severe losses, is, at least, a proof of determination.
But the British submarine service has to its credit a
record of work which, so far as can be judged from the
evidence available, is not only better but has been
performed under more difficult and dangerous circumstances.
In the North Sea patrolling has been carried
out regularly, in spite of minefields and of possible
danger from the British squadrons, which must, of
course, be avoided as carefully as if they were enemies.
The German High Seas Fleet has been, for the most
part, in hiding, but on the rare and brief occasions
when their ships have ventured on one of their furtive
raids British submarines have done their part, and the
only two German Dreadnoughts which have risked themselves
outside Kiel since their Jutland flight were both
torpedoed on the same day. Better opportunities,
as we shall see later, were found in the Baltic, where
British submarines, in spite of German and Swedish
nets, ice-fields, and the great distance of bases, succeeded
in establishing a complete panic, by torpedoing a number
of German war vessels and the cargo ships which they
were intended to safeguard.</p>

<p>But it was in the Gallipoli campaign that the conditions
were most trying and most novel. The British
submarines detailed for the attack in Turkish waters
had to begin by navigating the Dardanelles against
a very rapid current, setting strongly into a succession<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32">32</a></span>
of bays. They had to pass searchlights, mines, torpedo-tubes,
nets and guard-boats; and in the Sea of Marmora
they were awaited by a swarm of cruisers, destroyers,
and patrol-boats of all kinds. Yet, from the very first,
they were successful in defeating all these. Boat after
boat went up without a failure, and maintained herself
for weeks at a time without a base, returning with an
astonishing record of losses inflicted on the enemy.
These records will be given more fully in a later chapter;
but that of E.&nbsp;14, Lieut.-Commander Courtney Boyle,
may be quoted here as an example, because it is no
exceptional instance but merely the earliest of a number,
and set a standard which was well maintained by
those who followed. The passage of the narrows was
made through the Turkish mine-field, and its difficulty
may be judged by the fact that E.&nbsp;14, during the first
64 hours of the voyage, was diving for 44 hours and 50
minutes. After she began her patrol work, there was
more than one day on which she was under fire the whole
day, except when she dived from time to time. The
difficulty of using her torpedoes was extreme; but she
succeeded in hitting and sinking two transports, one
of which was 1,500 yards distant and escorted by
three destroyers. Finally when, after twenty-two days’
patrolling, she began her return voyage, she was
shepherded by a Turkish gunboat, a torpedo-boat, and
a tug, one each side of her and one astern, and all
hoping to catch her in the net; but by deep and skilful
diving she escaped them, and cleared the net and the
mine-field at a speed of 7 knots.</p>

<p>Her second patrol extended over twenty-three days.
This time the tide was stronger, and the weather less
favourable. The total number of steamers, grain dhows<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33">33</a></span>
and provision ships, sunk on this patrol, amounted
to no less than ten, and the return voyage was successfully
accomplished, the boat tearing clean through an
obstruction off Bokali Kalessi.</p>

<p>The third patrol was again twenty-two days. An
hour after starting, E.&nbsp;14 had her foremost hydroplane
fouled by an obstruction which jammed it for the
moment, and threw the ship eight points off her course.
After a quick scrape she got clear, but found afterwards
that her guard wire was nearly cut through. On this
trip the wireless apparatus was for a time out of order,
but was successfully repaired; eight good ships were
burnt or sunk, one of them being a supply ship of
5,000 tons. The return voyage was the most eventful
of all. E.&nbsp;14 came full against the net at Nagara,
which had apparently been extended since she went up.
The boat was brought up from 80 feet to 45 feet in three
seconds, but broke away uninjured, with her bow and
periscope standards scraped and scored.</p>

<p>The efficiency of the boat and her crew were beyond
praise. Since leaving England E.&nbsp;14 had run over
12,000 miles and had spent nearly seventy days at
close quarters with the enemy in the Sea of Marmora;
she had never been in a dockyard or out of running
order; she had had no engine defects except such as
were immediately put right by her own engine-room
staff. Yet she made no claim to be better than her
consorts. Nor did she make any boast of her humane
treatment of captured enemies; she merely followed
the tradition of the British Navy in this matter, and
the principles of law as accepted by all civilised nations.
The commander of a submarine, whether British or
German, has to contend with certain difficulties which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34">34</a></span>
did not trouble the cruiser captain of former wars. He
cannot spare, from his small ship’s company, a prize
crew to take a captured vessel into port; he cannot,
except in very rare cases, hope to take her in himself;
and, again, if he is to sink her, he cannot find room
in his narrow boat for more than one or two prisoners.
What he can do is to see that non-combatants and
neutrals, at least, shall be exposed as little as possible
to danger or suffering; he can give them boats and
supplies and every opportunity of reaching land in
safety. No one needs to be told how the Germans,
either of their own native cruelty or by the orders of
a brutal and immoral Higher Command, have in such
circumstances chosen to deal with their helpless fellow-men,
and even with women and children, and with the
wounded and those attending them. But it may be
well to put in evidence some of the brief notes in which
a typical British submarine commander has recorded
as a matter of course his own method on similar occasions.
‘May 8. Allowed two steamers full of refugees
to proceed.’ ‘June 20. Boarded and sank 3 sailing
dhows; towed crew inshore and gave them some
biscuit, beef, and rum and water, as they were rather
wet.’ ‘June 22. Let go passenger ship. 23. Burnt
two-master and started to tow crew in their boat, but
had to dive. Stopped 2 dhows: crews looked so
miserable that I only sank one and let the other go.
24. Blew up 2 large dhows; saw 2 heads in the water
near another ship; turned and took them up exhausted,
gave them food and drink and put them on
board their own ship.’ ‘July 30. Burnt sailing vessel
with no boat and spent remainder of afternoon trying
to find a craft to get rid of her crew into. Found small<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35">35</a></span>
sailing boat and got rid of them.’ ‘August 3. Burnt
large dhow. Unfortunately, 9 on board, including 2
very old men, and their boat was small, so I had to
take them on board and proceed with them close to
the shore&mdash;got rid of them at 9.30 <span class="smcap smaller">P.M.</span>’</p>

<p>As for the hospital ships, there were numbers of
them coming and going; but, empty or full, it is inconceivable
that the British Navy should make war
upon hospital ships. Victory it will desire, but not by
villainy; defeat it will avoid strenuously, but not by
the destruction of the first law of human life. The
result is none the less certain: in the history of submarine
war, as in that of all naval war, it will inevitably
be seen that piracy and murder are not the methods of
the strong.</p>

<h2 class="vspace"><a id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III<br />

<span class="subhead">THE SUBMARINE OF TO-DAY</span></h2>
</div>

<p>The feelings of the average landsman, when he sets
foot for the first time in a submarine, are a strong
mixture of curiosity and apprehension. The curiosity
is uppermost&mdash;the experience before you is much more
novel than, for example, that of a first trip in an aeroplane.
From a mountain or tower, a great wheel or a
balloon, you have seen the bird’s-eye view of the earth
and felt the sensation of hanging over the aerial abyss.
But even the fascinating pages of Jules Verne have not
told you all that you will feel in a submarine, and
nothing but physical experience can do so. You are
eager to see the working of new mechanical devices
in a wholly strange element, and to learn the use of a
new weapon in a wholly strange kind of war. But with
this eagerness, there is an underlying sense of uneasiness,
a feeling that you are putting yourself into a position
where you are as helpless as a mouse in a patent trap.
The cause of this is not fear of war risks, for it is equally
strong in harbour, or in time of peace. It is probably
connected with the common dread of suffocation, which
may be an instinct inherited from ages of primitive
life in the open. They will tell you, in the submarine
service, that it is a mere habit of mind and very soon
forgotten. There is even a story of an officer who, on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37">37</a></span>
coming ashore from a year’s work in an E-boat, refused
to travel in the Tube railway, because it looked so
dangerous. He preferred the risks he was used to, and
so do most of us.</p>

<p>You stand, then, at the foot of the narrow iron ladder
down which you have come from the upper air, you
gag your inherited instinct, and let your curiosity loose.
Before the boat dives, there is time for a good deal to
be taken in. The interior seems large beyond expectation.
This is partly an illusion, produced by the vista
of the compartments, fore and aft of the central control
where you are standing. The bulkhead doors being all
open at this moment, you can see into the engine and
motor rooms towards the stern, and forward through
the battery compartment to the bow torpedo-tubes.
The number of men seems large too, and they are all
busy; but you note that every part of them is more
active than their feet&mdash;there is very little coming and
going. In the control, close to you, are the captain,
a lieutenant, a steersman, and seven or eight other
men for working the ballast tanks, air valves, electrical
apparatus, and hydroplanes. The last two of
them have just come down from the deck&mdash;the hatches
are closed&mdash;engines have already been running
for some minutes, though the order escaped your
observation.</p>

<p>You are invited ‘to see her dive.’ You go up to
the forward conning-tower scuttle and flatten your face
against the thick glass. An order is given. You hear
the hissing of air, as the ballast tanks are filled. You
expect to see the forward part of the boat dip down into
the water in which she is heaving. Instead of that, it is
apparently the sea which lifts itself up, moves along<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38">38</a></span>
the deck, and seems to be coming in a huge slow
wave over your scuttle. The light of day gives place
to a green twilight, full of small bubbles. Mentally
you feel a slight chill; but physically, a warm and sticky
sensation. As there is nothing more to be seen out of
window, you return to your instructor. He explains
to you that the ship is now running on her motors, and
that her speed is therefore low&mdash;not nearly enough
to overhaul a vessel or convoy of any power. On the
surface, with her other engines, she could far more than
double the pace; and even with the motors, she could do
a spurt for a short time&mdash;but spurts are very expensive;
for they use up the battery power with ruinous rapidity,
and then a return to the surface will be necessary,
whether safe or not.</p>

<p>At this point it may strike you suddenly that you
are now under water&mdash;you begin to wonder how deep
you are, and why you have not perceived any change
in the boat’s position. The answer is that the depth
marked on the gauges is only twenty feet, and the angle
of descent was therefore very slight&mdash;much too slight
to be perceptible in the short length of a single compartment.
The depth of twenty feet is now being maintained
with surprising steadiness; the explanation is
that two entirely separate forces are at work. First,
there are the horizontal rudders or hydroplanes, fitted
outside the vessel both fore and aft, by which she can
be forced down, provided she has sufficient way on,
in much the same fashion as an ordinary vertical rudder
forces a ship to one side or the other. But this is only
the diving apparatus; to keep her down, there is her
water ballast&mdash;the water which was taken into her main
ballast tanks, when the order to submerge was given.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39">39</a></span>
These tanks contain a sufficient weight of water to
counteract the normal buoyancy of the boat, by which
she would naturally float upon the surface. When
they are emptied, she will neither sink nor rise of her
own motion&mdash;she will lie or run at whatever depth she
is placed, by her hydroplanes or otherwise.</p>

<p>These, you will have noticed, were called the ‘main’
ballast tanks&mdash;there would seem then to be others.
There are, and several kinds of them. First, there is
an auxiliary ballast tank, which has a peculiar use of
its own. A submarine must be able to float or submerge
in fresh water as well as at sea; for her base or harbour
will often be in the mouth of a river, or she may have
to navigate a river, a canal, or a lake. It is a point
that would not probably have occurred to you, but the
difference between the density of fresh and salt water is
sufficiently great to make a real difficulty here. Everyone
knows that it is less easy to float in fresh water,
and less easy to sink in salt. For practical purposes,
a submerged boat is less buoyant in fresh water by
26 tons in 1000, and <i>vice versa</i>; so that when a submarine
of 1000 tons leaves a river for the sea, she must
take an extra 26 tons of ballast to keep her down, and
when she comes home again she must get rid of 26 tons,
or she will sink so much deeper in the fresh water.
For this purpose she has a special tank of the right
size, proportioned to her tonnage; and it is placed in
the middle of the ship, in order that it may not interfere
with her trim when it is filled or emptied.</p>

<p>That last remark will put you in mind that, in any
kind of navigation, the trim of the boat is a delicate
and important matter. Even in very large and heavy
ships you may be able, by shifting guns or cargo, to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40">40</a></span>
slip off a shoal, or right a leaking vessel after a collision.
In a tickle boat like a submarine, it is necessary to have
some means of trimming the vessel, fore or aft, at any
moment, and especially when about to dive, or when
caught by some under-water obstruction. Tanks are
therefore fitted for this purpose at each end of the boat.
They are comparatively small, because the effect required
is in ordinary circumstances very limited, and in a
desperate emergency they may need to be supplemented
by rushing the crew fore or aft, as living ballast. An
example of this will be found in a later chapter.</p>

<p>You may now feel that you have heard enough of
tanks; but your instructor will insist on showing you
a whole additional series. He will make a point of
your recognising that a submarine, when submerged,
is in reality hanging in the water as a balloon hangs in
the air, and for every loss of weight she must be instantaneously
compensated, or she will begin to rise.
What loss of weight can she suffer while actually under
water? It is not perhaps very hard to guess. There is,
first of all, the consumption of oil by the engines;
secondly, the consumption of food and fresh water by
the crew; and thirdly, the departure from time to time of
torpedoes. Also, when on the surface, there may be gun
ammunition fired away, or other things heaved overboard,
and allowance must be made for this when the boat
goes down again. The modern submarine is prepared to
keep her balance under all such circumstances. She
has compensating tanks, and they are placed as near
as possible to the oil-tank, fresh-water tank, or torpedo-tube,
for whose diminished weight they are to
compensate.</p>

<p>You are probably more interested in the torpedo-<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41">41</a></span>tubes
than in the oil-tanks. It is time then to go forward.
You pass through the battery compartment,
where the officers’ quarters are, and are shown (under
the floor) the accumulators, ranged like the honey
sections in the frames of a beehive, and very carefully
covered over with flexible waterproof covering as well
as with close-jointed planking. What would happen
if water did find its way down to the batteries? An
instant discharge of chlorine gas, blinding and suffocating.
What would you do then? Come to the
surface at all costs&mdash;and lucky if you are in time! The
Germans know all about that&mdash;and not long ago one
of our own boats was only saved by the good goal-keeping
of a lieutenant, who caught up a lid of some sort, and
stood by the leak, neatly fending off the water spurt
from the door of the battery compartment.</p>

<p>Now you are in the forward torpedo compartment,
and there are the tubes. I need not say anything
about their size or number&mdash;you will realise at a glance
that when a couple are loosed off at once, a good deal
of weight goes out of the ship. The ordinary 18-inch
fish is 17 feet long, and takes some handling. The
explosive alone in her war-head weighs as much as
a big man, say 12½ stone, and a 21-inch fish carries
twice as much as that, packed in some four feet of her
length. Behind that comes the air chamber&mdash;another
ten feet&mdash;with the compressed air to drive the engine,
which is in her stern. The air is stored at a pressure
of over 2000 lbs. to the square inch; so the steel walls
of the chamber must be thick, and this makes another
heavy item. Lastly, there is the engine-box with its
four-cylinder engine, two propellers, gyroscope and
steering gear. Altogether, an 18-inch fish will weigh<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42">42</a></span>
nearly three-quarters of a ton, and a 21-inch over 2000
lbs., so that the amount of compensation needed when
you fire, is considerable.</p>

<p>To see how it is done, we will imagine ourselves firing
this starboard tube. The torpedo is got ready, and
special care is taken to make sure that the firing-pin
in her nose is not forgotten. Cases have been known
in which a ship has been hit full by a torpedo which
did not explode&mdash;just as a good many Zeppelin bombs
were found in London, after the early raids, with the
detonating pin not drawn. The fish is now ready to
come alive, and is slid into the tube. The door is shut
behind it, and the water-tight outer door, at the other
end of the tube, is now ready to be opened by powerful
levers. But the immediate result of this opening would
be an inrush of sea-water which would weigh the boat’s
head down; for though the fish’s belly fits the tube
pretty closely, there is a good deal of empty space where
it tapers towards the nose and tail. Here comes in
the tank system. When the tube is loaded, this empty
space is filled by water from within the ship, so that no
change of weight occurs when you open the outer door.
But when the firing-button has been pushed, and the
torpedo has been shot out by an air-charge behind it
there is no possibility of preventing the whole tube
from filling with water, and this water must be got rid
of before the tube can be reloaded. To do this, you
first close the outer door again; then you have to
deal with the tubeful of water. A good part of it
is what the ship herself supplied to fill the space
round the torpedo; and this must be pumped back
into the special tank it came from. The remainder is
the sea-water which rushed in, to take the place left<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43">43</a></span>
empty by the departing torpedo: and this must be
pumped into another special tank to prevent the ship
feeling the loss of the torpedo’s weight. When you
get a fresh supply of torpedoes, these special compensating
tanks (which are really a kind of dummy
torpedoes) will be emptied out, one for each new torpedo.
Meantime, you have now got the tube empty, and can
open the inner door and reload.</p>

<p>But what of the torpedo which has been fired? It
is travelling towards its mark at a speed of between
thirty-five and forty knots, if we suppose the range to be
an ordinary one, under 1000 yards, and the torpedo to
have been ‘run hot,’ <i>i.e.</i> driven by hot air instead of
cold. The compressed air is heated mechanically inside
the torpedo, in the act of passing from the air chamber
to the machinery, and this increases both the speed and
range. But it is not always convenient or possible to
start the heating apparatus, and even when ‘run cold’
the fish will do thirty knots. This speed is amazing,
but it is one of the least wonderful of the torpedo’s
qualities. The steering of the machine is a double
miracle. One device makes it take, after the first plunge,
exactly the depth you desire, and another&mdash;a gyroscope
fitted inside the rudder gear&mdash;keeps it straight on its
course; or makes it, if you wish, turn in a circle and
strike its prey, boomerang fashion. The head of the
fish can also be fitted with cutters which will cut through
any torpedo-netting that a ship can afford to carry.
The only thing that no ingenuity can accomplish is
to make a torpedo invisible during its run. The compressed
air, when it has passed through the engine, must
escape, and it comes to the surface in a continuous
boiling line of bubbles. This is visible at a considerable<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44">44</a></span>
distance; and though, when the track is sighted by the
look-out, the torpedo itself is of course always well ahead
of the nearest spot where the bubbles are seen rising,
it is surprising how often ships do succeed in avoiding
a direct shot. A prompt cry from the look-out, a
steersman ready to put his helm over instantly, and the
torpedo goes bubbling past, a few feet ahead or astern,
or comes in on a tangent and runs harmlessly along
the ship’s side without exploding. Then away it goes
across the open sea, until the compressed air is exhausted,
the engine stops, and the mechanical sinker
sends it to the ocean bed, which must be fairly strewn
with dead torpedoes by this time; for as we know, to
our advantage, the proportion of misses to hits is very
large in the U-boat’s record.</p>

<p>Now that you have seen the weapon&mdash;and can at
any rate imagine the handling of it&mdash;you are naturally
keen to sight the game, and realise the conditions of
a good shot. You go back to the central compartment,
where the Commander is ready to show you a ship
through the periscope. Not, of course, an enemy ship&mdash;in
this war, if you want a shot at an enemy ship, you
must go into his own waters&mdash;into the Bight or the
Baltic&mdash;to find him; and even there he is probably tucked
up very tight in his berth, with chained barges and
heavy nets all round him, and mines all up the approach.
But there are plenty of our own ships out every day&mdash;sweeping,
cruising, trading; and transporting men, food,
mails, and munitions. And what you see will help you
to understand why the Germans have spent so many
torpedoes, and sunk so comparatively small a proportion
of our enormous tonnage.</p>

<p>The boat is now less deep in the water; the gauges<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45">45</a></span>
mark 15 feet, and you are told that the top of the periscope
is therefore some two feet above the surface.
The shaft of it is round, like a large vertical piston;
but at the bottom it ends in a flattened box, with a hand-grip
projecting on each side. You take hold of the
grips and look into the box. Nothing is visible but an
expanse of water, with a coast-line of low hills beyond it&mdash;all
in miniature. The Commander presses the back of
your left hand on the grip, and you move round slowly
as the periscope revolves. The coast-line goes out of
the picture, the sea lies open to the horizon, and upon
it appears a line of odd-looking spots. They are moving;
for the nearest one, which was narrow a moment ago,
is now three or four times as broad, and is in a different
place in the line.</p>

<p>The line, you are told, is not a line at all, but a
convoy, in fairly regular formation. The nearest spot
is a destroyer, zigzagging on the flank; the others are
ships which have been so effectively ‘dazzled’ that
their shapes are unrecognisable. You carry on, in hope
of something nearer, and suddenly a much larger object
comes into the field of vision. A ship, of course, though
it does not look like any ship you have ever seen; and
you are asked to guess its distance and direction. You
are bewildered at first; for as you were moving the lens
rapidly to starboard, the vessel came in rapidly to
port, and as her dazzle-paint makes her stern indistinguishable
from her bows, you continue to think she
is steaming in that direction. After a more careful
observation, this mistake is corrected. She is crossing
us from port to starboard. But at what angle? This
is vitally important, for the possibility of getting in a
successful shot would depend entirely upon the answer.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46">46</a></span>
We are ourselves heading about due north: she is
crossing to the east: if her course is south of east, she
is coming nearer to us, and our torpedo would strike
her before the beam&mdash;the most favourable chance.
If, on the contrary, her course is north of east she is
going away, and the torpedo would have a poor chance
of hitting her abaft the beam. In fact, it would not be
worth while to risk losing so costly a shot. A torpedo
at present prices is worth not far short of £2000, and
we only carry two for each tube.</p>

<p>You look long and hard at this dazzle-ship. She
doesn’t give you any sensation of being dazzled; but
she is, in some queer way, all wrong&mdash;her proportions are
wrong, she is somehow not herself, not what she ought
to be. If you fix your attention on one end of her, she
seems to point one way&mdash;if you look away at her other
end, she is doing something different. You can’t see
the height of her funnels clearly, or their relative position.
But, with care, you decide that she is coming
about south-east and will be therefore your bird in
two minutes’ time. The Commander is interested.
He takes a look himself, laughs, and puts you back at
the eye-piece. You hold on in hope that he may, after
all, be wrong; but the bird ends by getting well away
to the north-east. Your error covered just ninety
degrees, and the camouflage had beaten you completely.
You begin to think that the ingenuity at command of
the nation has been underestimated. But this ship
is nothing of a dazzle, the Commander tells you&mdash;he
can show you one whose cut-water seems always to be
moving at a right angle to her stern!</p>

<div id="if_i_047" class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
  <img src="images/i_047.jpg" width="450" height="449" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">‘Does not look like any ship you have ever seen.’</div></div>

<p>He adds that he knew all about that cruiser, and
she knew all about him. Otherwise he would not have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47">47</a><a class="hidev" id="Page_48">48</a><br /><a class="hidev" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
shown even his periscope; and if he had, she would
have had a shell into him by now, and a depth-charge
to follow. A depth-charge is perhaps the most formidable
weapon against which the submarine has to be on
guard. It is a bomb, with a detonator which can be
set to explode when it reaches any given depth. A
small one would need to hit the mark full, or be very
close to it, in order to get a satisfactory result; but the
newer and larger ones will seriously damage a submarine
within an area of forty yards. The charge is either
dropped over the stern of the pursuing vessel, when she
is thought to be just over or just ahead of the enemy;
or it is fired out of a small and handy short-range howitzer&mdash;a
kind of lob-shot, a number of which can be made
by several patrol boats acting together, so as to cover a
larger area with much less risk of embarrassing each
other. Even if the submarine is not destroyed outright,
the chances are in such a case that she will be so damaged
as to be forced to the surface or to the bottom, and then
the end is certain. A bad leak would bring her up&mdash;an
injury to her tanks or rudders might drive her down.</p>

<p>You are uncomfortably reminded once more of
that inherited dislike of death by suffocation. If a
submarine cannot rise to the surface, you ask, is there
no possible means of escape? The answer is that it
may be possible, with great difficulty, to get out of the
boat; but there is very little chance that you would
survive. The lungs are not fitted to bear so great and
sudden a change of pressure as that felt in passing from
the boat to the water, and from the deep water to the
surface. You are perhaps surprised; but the pressure
of sea-water at 160 feet is equal to five atmospheres,
or about 75 lbs. to the square inch. To pass safely<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50">50</a></span>
through this to the ordinary surface atmosphere would
need a long and gradual process, and not a sudden
rise of a few seconds. A very brave attempt was made
on one occasion, when a British submarine had gone
to the bottom during her trials, and could not be got
up by any effort of her crew. The agony of the situation
was intensified by the fact that help was close at hand, if
only the alarm could be given, and the whereabouts of the
submarine communicated to the rescuers. The officers
of the sunken boat were, of course, perfectly aware
of the danger from sudden change of pressure; but one
of them volunteered to go to the surface, alive or dead,
and carry a message on the chance of attracting some
ship’s attention. To lessen the risk as far as possible,
it was arranged that he should go up into the conning-tower,
and that the hatch should then be closed beneath
him and the water gradually admitted. As it flowed
slowly in, and mounted round him, the air in the top
of the conning-tower would diminish in extent but
increase in pressure. When it reached his neck, the
internal pressure would be nearly equal to the external.
He would be able to open the top, possibly to make his
escape, and conceivably to reach the surface without his
lungs being fatally injured. If he failed, he would at
any rate have given his life for the chance of saving his
comrades.</p>

<p>The Commander accompanied him into the conning-tower,
meaning, it is said, to return into the ship himself
when he had seen to all the arrangements. But when
the water was admitted, the two of them were shot out
together, and as it happened it was the volunteer who
was killed, by striking against the superstructure,
while the Commander came up alive. In no long time&mdash;though<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51">51</a></span>
it must have seemed unendurably long to
those below, waiting in complete uncertainty&mdash;the
rescuers were informed, found the submarine, and got
a hawser under her stern. They raised her high
enough out of the water, vertically, to open a hatch
and save the crew. Then the hawser gave, and the
boat went down again.</p>

<p>That story is not unlikely to haunt you all the way
home, and for a long time afterwards. It may even
make a difference to your whole feeling about the war
under water, as waged by our own Service. The
submarine is not merely an incredibly clever box of
mechanical toys, nor is it only the fit weapon of a cruel
and ruthless enemy; it is also a true part of the Navy
without fear and without reproach, whose men play
the great game for each other and for their country,
and play it more greatly than we know. The tune of
their service is a kind of undertone; but it is in the
heroic key, and cannot fall below it.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="vspace"><a id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV<br />

<span class="subhead">A BRITISH SUBMARINE BASE</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Our submarine now returns to the surface. She is
proceeding on patrol, and her commander, as he bids
us good-bye, recommends us to put into the port from
which he has just come, and see what a submarine base
is like. We take his advice, and return to our trawler.
Her head is turned westward and signals are made and
answered. The skipper informs us that we are about
to pass through a mine-field where the mines are as
thick as herring-roe. It is some consolation to hear
that ‘The Sweep’ has already done its daily morning
work, and that the channel is presumably clear.</p>

<p>The East Coast of England, from Tynemouth to
Thames mouth, is pierced with some ten or a dozen
estuaries, all more or less suitable for flotilla bases.
It is unnecessary to say how many of these are used by
our submarines, or which of them it is that we are about
to enter. But a short description can do no harm,
because one of these bases is very like another, and
all are absolutely impervious to enemy craft. Even
if they could navigate the mine-field, so thickly strewn
with both our mines and their own, and so constantly
and thoughtfully rearranged, they would not find it
possible to slip, as we are doing, past the elaborate
boom at the harbour mouth, or to escape being sunk<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53">53</a></span>
by the guns which dominate it, and the seaplanes which
are constantly passing over it.</p>

<p>And now that we are inside, it looks an even more
dangerous place for an intruder&mdash;a perfect hornets’ nest.
Close to us on the left lies a small pier, with buildings
on a hill behind it&mdash;the Commodore’s house and offices,
seamen’s training-school, and gymnasium. At the
pier-head are two or three picket-boats; and a little
further on, a light cruiser with her observation balloon
mounted. The vast sheds beyond are the hangars of
the Air Service. They are painted in a kind of Futurist
style, which gives them a queer look from below, but
makes them, when seen from a thousand feet up, either
invisible or like a landscape of high roads, cornfields,
hay-stacks and groups of trees&mdash;objects quite uninviting
to any stray air-raider. But their best protection is
the efficiency of the machines and men inside them.</p>

<p>Over on the opposite side of the river stretches a
long quay. The background of it is a naval railway
station; the ships lying in front of it are partly supply
ships, partly merchant vessels brought in under convoy,
and two of them are depot ships, moored permanently
there, and used as headquarters for the Submarine,
Destroyer, and other services. Out in the centre of the
harbour lies a still larger depot ship, the floating headquarters
of the Admiral who is Commodore of the port;
and behind her, in two long lines, stretching away
upstream into the far distance, lies an apparently
inexhaustible force of light cruisers, destroyers, and
destroyer-leaders, with here and there a submarine&mdash;one
is slung aloft in a dry-dock for overhauling. A side
creek to the left is crowded with trawlers and drifters,
whose men are now ashore ‘between sweeps.’ At this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54">54</a></span>
hour of the day the place is at its fullest, for the daily
‘Beef Trip,’ or food convoy, has just come in, and the
dozen destroyers which escorted it are all lying at
their moorings, on both sides of the main stream line.
There they will be till to-night, when at 7 o’clock to
the second they will all slip away again into the twilight
like thin grey ghostly dogs, shepherding another flock
of very substantial sheep.</p>

<p>The trawler puts us aboard the depot ship; but
the Admiral is not there. A picket-boat takes us
over to his pier, and we find him in his chart-room,
surrounded by maps marked with spots and figures
in different colours, quite unintelligible except to those
who have the key, and even to them no subject for
conversation at large. But the Admiral is a good talker,
his mind is an encyclopædia of submarine war and the
working of a naval base, and he is amazingly quick
in separating the facts which interest you, and yet are
fit for repetition outside, from those which you must
forget as soon as you have heard them. He begins by
explaining the daily routine of the port&mdash;the mine-sweeping,
which is done regularly twice a day, but at
what times the enemy can only guess, and the mine-laying,
which is a game of brain against brain, each
side trying to see through the other’s devices and catch
him with their own. An elementary example would
be the obvious dodge of moving the enemy’s mine a
short distance, instead of removing it altogether&mdash;so
that when next he comes that way, he shall run into
it unexpectedly, and perish by his own trap. But this,
as I have described it, is too simple a device to be
successful, and the ingenuity of our mine-layers has
improved upon it by a dozen skilful variations. Much<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55">55</a></span>
can be done by studying carefully the habits of the
German mind. One officer, who is specially skilled in
this matter, has the credit of being able to make a
U.C.-boat lay her eggs just where he pleases, and of
knowing exactly when it will be time to go and collect
them.</p>

<p>Our own mine-laying and coastal patrol would be
more exciting if the possible successes were not limited
to an occasional submarine. It is a little dull to be
always laying traps for a flotilla that never comes.
The work of our coastal submarines is therefore monotonous;
but it is none the less invaluable. Besides
making sure, it trains a continual succession of crews
for oversea work, and gives experience to young commanders.
The number of boats increases every year,
and the flow of volunteer entries keeps pace with it.
The standard demanded is very high, and it is fully
maintained. The prize of efficiency is immediate entry
into the hardships and dangers of the oversea patrol.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that the hardships are more
trying to our men than the dangers. The oversea
patrol is kept up through the winter. The weather
off the enemy’s coast is often very severe, and boats
have to be shut down for long periods. In summer, the
work of diving patrols is almost equally arduous, owing
to the longer hours of daylight. Boats must frequently
be submerged for nineteen or twenty hours at a time; and
after the first twelve of these, the air, in spite of purifiers,
becomes oppressive to breathe&mdash;not even the head of
a match will burn. Then there are two special conditions
tending towards depression. First, the positive
results are few, and form no measure of the work or
the risks. Results are obtained, but never in proportion<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56">56</a></span>
to the devotion and sanguine hopes of the Service. It
is a baffling and trying experience to live for days with
your eye glued to a periscope&mdash;the field of vision is
contracted, and too close to the water. The psychological
effect of the strain would be bad in the case
of any but highly trained and selected officers&mdash;as one
of them has said, the sighting of a surface enemy is a
relief seldom obtained. The Germans are fortunate
in the daily, almost hourly, sighting of targets. But
their officers, in consequence of continual heavy losses,
are commonly sent to sea undertrained, and their results
are naturally poor in proportion to the torpedoes
expended.</p>

<p>The second of the two causes which would discourage
any but the finest spirit, is the fact that an almost
complete silence broods over the Submarine Service.
Not only is the work done mostly in the deep-sea twilight;
but, however arduous and creditable it may be,
it is seldom recognised publicly. Rewards are given,
but not openly. A commander may reappear for a day
or two among his friends, wearing the ribbon of the
D.S.O. or the V.C., or both, but little or nothing will
be published of the actions by which he won them. It
is not only that information must be kept from reaching
the enemy&mdash;and naturally the German Admiralty
is always anxious to know how their boats are lost&mdash;but
there is also a settled custom in our Navy, a
custom older than the Submarine Service, by which
‘mention in despatches’ is confined to incidents during
which one or both sides have been under fire, from gun
or torpedo. Custom in the Navy is generally a sound
rule; but in this particular instance, the custom did
not grow up to fit the case, and does not fit it. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57">57</a></span>
Admiral does not say anything on this point; but he
tells us that the real danger a submarine commander
has to face is not the gun or the torpedo. He may
come off his patrol without having been shot at by
either, and yet may be entitled to the credit of having
been in action for days and nights on end. In fact,
every minute that he is in enemy waters he is in danger
from mines, and from a host of formidable pursuers&mdash;aeroplanes
and Zeppelins with bombs, and fast anti-submarine
craft with depth-charges and explosive sweeps.
No doubt all ships are to some extent in danger from
mines, but no other class of vessel is asked to run the
gauntlet on the enemy’s coast to anything like the
same extent. If surface ships are sent, they are sent
for a single operation, the ground is prepared for them
as far as possible, the period of exposure is short, and
when the work is done the force is withdrawn. But
our submarines are, for days and weeks at a time, close
to known mine-fields and in areas most likely to hold
new or drifted mines. They are harassed by hunters
to whom they can make no reply, and particularly by
aircraft, which can detect them even at sixty feet
below the surface. The areas in which they work
are comparatively narrow, and so closely patrolled by
small craft that it is seldom possible to come to the
surface in daylight; navigation, too, is very difficult,
and the rapidly changing densities of the water off the
enemy’s coast make the trimming of the boat and the
depth control a matter of constant anxiety.</p>

<p>Yet not only are officers and men found in plenty
to enter this service of twilight and silence, but the
keenness they show for it is unfailing. The work itself
is their one ambition, and their records are astounding.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58">58</a></span>
Ask the Captain (S.) of this port. In two years he
has organised 370 cruises, lasting in all 1680 days, and
extending over a surface mileage of more than 200,000
miles. There was only a single breakdown, and that
ended in a triumph; for the Commander got himself
towed back by an enemy trawler, neatly captured for
the purpose. Another&mdash;Commander Talbot&mdash;made
twenty-one cruises; Lieutenant C. Turner, nineteen;
Commanders Goodhart and Leir, seventeen each;
Commander Benning and Lieut. C. Moncreiffe, sixteen.
More wonderful still is the fact that the first two of
these officers spent fifty-six and sixty-five days respectively
in enemy waters, and the other four from
thirty-six to forty-nine days each. The most interesting
part of their adventures cannot yet be told; but much
may be guessed from an outline or two. Commander
Leir, for instance, was repeatedly in action with Zeppelins,
seaplanes, and anti-submarine craft, one of which he
sank. He was present at the action in the Heligoland
Bight in August 1914, and brought home some German
prisoners. Commander Benning was also repeatedly
in action. Once, after torpedoing an armed auxiliary
cruiser, he was forced by enemy sweepers to dive into
a German mine-field. There he had to stay, with
batteries exhausted, till night gave him a chance of
recharging. Another time he went down into a mine-field
of his own will, to lie in wait for an armed auxiliary.
He was there for three hours, but ambushed her successfully
in the end, close to the German coast. Lieut.-Commander
Turner covered 20,000 miles to his own
score, and passed much of his time actually in the
swept channels, with enemy patrols in sight the whole
day. Sometimes he came up and fought them, sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59">59</a><a class="hidev" id="Page_60">60</a><br /><a id="Page_61">61</a></span>
they hunted him with depth-charges. For those who
sleep in beds and travel in buses, it is an almost unimaginable
life. ‘Yes,’ says the Admiral, ‘in this Service,
officers need a two-o’clock-in-the-morning courage
every hour they are at sea: and they have it.’</p>

  <div class="caption">‘Towed back by an enemy trawler.’</div></div>

<p>The charts are put away. We move out, first to
the gymnasium, where physical drill is going on, then
towards the great air-sheds. As we approach the first
of these, an officer meets us and hands a block to the
Admiral with the morning report upon it.</p>

<p>The Admiral’s face lights up as he reads. ‘A lucky
chance&mdash;something to interest you.’ The Beef Trip,
it appears, which has just returned, was escorted as
usual by two seaplanes, flying ahead of the convoy.
The starboard one of these had sighted a submarine
at 8.30 <span class="smcap smaller">A.M.</span> and swooped towards her instantly. She
was nearly submerged when the seaplane passed over
her, but the two big depth-charges which were dropped
in a flash, fell right into her wash and close to the
conning-tower, which disappeared in the explosion.</p>

<p>An excellent bit of work! But the face of the officer
standing by shows a distinct cloud. ‘What is it?’ Well,
the fact is that the pilot of the other seaplane, a mile
and a half away to port, had an impression that the
submarine was British.</p>

<p>The pilot of the bomb-dropper is sent for and comes
out at once&mdash;a fair-haired and very young lieutenant,
with an air of perfectly undisturbed serenity. He
is sure nothing is wrong&mdash;it is ‘only a muddle.’ His
companion pilot had certainly sighted and spoken a
British submarine some quarter of an hour earlier;
but this was not the one. Also another boat, E.&nbsp;134,
was out on patrol in that precise direction, but she<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62">62</a></span>
was not due in that spot till 11 o’clock, B.S.T., and it
was highly improbable she would be there so much
before her time. Besides, he knew the colour of a Hun
conning-tower. Undoubtedly it was ‘only a muddle.’
The explanation sounds a good one, but it is a speculation,
not a certainty; and on further inquiry, it appears
that nothing has since been heard of E.&nbsp;134. The Admiral
sends off the young pilot with a word of good cheer;
but when he has gone, he hands back the report with a
serious look. The incident has become too interesting.
It is no longer something to tell a visitor. We go into
the sheds and spend the remainder of our time in viewing
the huge Americas and Handley-Pages.</p>

<p>The rest of the story comes after lunch, when we
go to visit the Captain (S.) in his depot ship. He has
heard all about our pilot, and our submarine too. E.&nbsp;134
lay all night in her billet, resting on the bottom at
140 feet and listening with all her hydrophones. In the
morning her watch was rewarded; she heard, first,
the monotonous low ticking of a German submarine’s
motors passing near her on the outward patrol&mdash;then
at 8.30 the heavy dull boom of two explosions close
together&mdash;then not a sound more! Finally, at her
appointed time, noting that the U-boat had never
stirred again, she rose to the surface and came home
in rear of the sweep. The muddle is cleared up, and
in the best manner.</p>

<div id="if_i_063" class="figcenter" style="width: 425px;">
  <img src="images/i_063.jpg" width="382" height="600" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">‘She was nearly submerged when the seaplane passed over her.’</div></div>

<p>We discuss the dead submarine and ask whether
she would be, or would have been, more formidable
when used against a convoy than against a single ship.
The Captain (S.) who has already been torpedoed once
himself, thinks there can be no doubt on this subject.
‘A single ship is much more easily approached than a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63">63</a><a class="hidev" id="Page_64">64</a><br /><a class="hidev" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
convoy&mdash;she has only one set of eyes on the look-out,
from one position, and the enemy can stalk her without
fear of being trodden on from other quarters. Convoys
ought to escape nearly every time, and they do.
Look at the record of this port&mdash;not one loss in two
years.’ This opinion is based on experience, but the
matter looks different from the point of view of the
convoy escort, whose responsibility weighs upon
him every day afresh. This we discover when we
pass on to visit a destroyer-leader, at a later hour
in the evening. She is being got ready for the
night’s work and it is now just six, but her captain
assures us that what remains of his time is entirely
ours. He takes us down to his own room, an elegant
and almost spacious apartment, very unlike anything to
be seen in a destroyer of the ordinary type; and he,
too, answers our question positively. ‘Which is easiest&mdash;to
hit a single ship or a convoy? The question
answers itself&mdash;a submarine ought to get at least one
bird out of a covey every time! She does not do it,
perhaps; but look at the trouble we take to prevent
her. Think of all the work put in by the auxiliary
patrol to keep the sea fairly clear to start with&mdash;armed
yachts, trawlers, whalers, drifters, motor-launches,
mine-sweepers, net-drifters and motor-boats, out day
and night all round the whole coast of the U.K. That
is their routine work; and besides that they supply
escorts to individual ships of special value and to ocean
convoys, when they have arrived at their port of initial
entry, and are to be taken on elsewhere. Then there
are the various kinds of protective devices for the ships
themselves&mdash;the dazzle-painting, the smoke-boxes on
broads, and the smoke-boxes for floating behind you.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66">66</a></span>
And since we <em>are</em> talking of these things, there is the
work of the destroyers and trawlers on regular convoy.’
This is, of course, the captain’s own job, and we naturally
hint a desire that he should pursue the subject.</p>

<p>‘There is no difficulty about it&mdash;the Germans already
know all that they can ever know of our convoy system&mdash;how
it is organised in the form of group-sailings on
definite routes, and worked, as far as possible, at night,
with extra protection given by daylight and during
moonlight hours&mdash;above all, how successful it is, and
how, little by little, they have given up the chase of
mercantile convoys for the attack of transports and
single ships of great size and value. In one month,
for instance, of the present year, 690 vessels were convoyed
from England to France, of which only three were
attacked, and only two sunk, including one small sailing
ship. More astonishing still, out of 693 convoyed
from France to England in the same month not one
was touched, or even attacked. Then there are the
Dutch and Scandinavian lines.’</p>

<p>We should like to know exactly how it is done, and
especially what part the destroyers play in the game.
Briefly, but very sharply, the picture is drawn for us.
You see a fine August day, off the coast of Scotland,
with white summer clouds over a rippling sea; a
compact convoy of eight ships sailing in two columns,
with a ninth lagging on the left, three times her proper
distance to the rear. Their speed is slow; they are flanked
on both sides, fore and aft, by armed trawlers, with one
just ahead of the two columns, and they are covered by
two fast destroyers. The first of these is ahead of the
convoy, zigzagging continuously from side to side across
the whole front. The second is zigzagging in another<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67">67</a></span>
direction. Suddenly, from this second destroyer, a
signal is seen to fly. Her look-out has spotted the wake
of a periscope 1000 yards away on her starboard bow,
moving to cut off the convoy, from the right column of
which it is already not more than 1500 yards distant.
A torpedo fired at this moment should cross the convoy
formation exactly in the middle, and would have an
excellent chance of sinking either of the centre ships
in either column&mdash;it could hardly miss all four. But
the destroyer has in a moment altered course 8 points
to starboard, and is prolonging this zigzag directly
towards the enemy at thirty-odd knots, with her forward
guns blazing. The U-boat captain, no doubt, longs
to take his shot into the brown; but he has less than
one minute in which to perform the more urgent duty
of saving his own ship. Down he goes, with a depth-charge
after him, and is not seen or heard of again
in this story. The convoy calls up its lame duck and
goes safely to its destination.</p>

<p>‘Yes,’ says the Captain, ‘we get them through, and
it all looks very simple; but it’s mostly a matter of
ten seconds, and you can’t grow fat on a daily margin
of ten seconds.’</p>

<p>‘But the Admiral has something to say on your
report?’</p>

<p>‘The Admiral writes outside, “Good look-out and
prompt action of <i>Swallow</i> probably averted a casualty
to the convoy.” He has to write that most days&mdash;he
must be tired of writing it.’</p>

<p>It is now two minutes to seven. As we drop into
our picket-boat, the destroyer slips silently from her
moorings and fades away down stream with eleven other
thin grey phantoms.</p>

<span class="subhead">SUBMARINES AND WAR POLICY</span></h2>
</div>

<p>‘Strategy,’ says the ‘Encyclopædia Britannica,’ ‘has
been curtly described as the art of concentrating an
effective fighting force at a given place at a given time,
and tactics as the art of using it when there.’ In less
scientific language, you fight a battle by means of tactics,
and a campaign by means of strategy. But when nations
live, as we have all been living for many years past,
in constant preparation for war, there must be forethought
as to the means and methods to be employed.
Each nation has broad general plans, ready for the
moment when fighting is decided upon, and ships, guns,
and armies are provided accordingly. This is what is
meant by war policy; and examples will come to
mind at once. We live in a group of islands, with
Dominions and other possessions overseas, and we have
no desire to attack our continental neighbours. British
war policy has therefore always been chiefly directed
to the provision of an invincible navy for defending our
shores and our commerce. The German Empire, on
the other hand, is practically self-contained; it lies
on the Continent, with land powers for neighbours whom
it has long hoped and intended to dominate. German
war policy, therefore, concerned itself until quite
recently with plans for aggression by land, and only<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69">69</a></span>
provided a powerful fleet when it became desirable to
have a weapon in hand against England&mdash;not necessarily
to fight us on equal terms, but, as they said themselves,
to make us hesitate to take sides against them.</p>

<p>In this way it came about that both countries had
a great naval war policy, and watched each other
carefully, building dreadnoughts against dreadnoughts,
and cruisers against cruisers. We made great and
successful efforts to keep the lead; for sea power is a
matter of life and death to us; and the Germans were
spending every mark they could spare, to get more and
more nearly upon even terms. It is certain that the
war policy of both Powers took account of the possible
uses of submarine boats; but the lines of thought
which they followed were in some ways widely different,
and they led, when war came, to unexpected developments.
Let us consider for a few moments what the
British admirals on the one hand, and the German
on the other, intended to do with their submarine forces,
and what they actually did when the time for action
came.</p>

<p>British war policy was essentially non-aggressive.
The Navy had but one possible antagonist of the first
rank at sea, and that one we should never have fought
with, except in a war of defence. Our submarines,
therefore, had two obvious duties marked out for them.
They would help in coast defence by making it dangerous
for ships of war or transports to approach, and they
might be used, if an opportunity arose, to attack a fleet
in harbour, or a cruiser at sea. There was every probability
that any fleet of a Power at war with us would
sooner or later have to spend a good deal of time in
port, and it would certainly be well to have the means<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70">70</a></span>
to attack it there. But, important as this function was,
the idea of defence against invasion probably came first,
and there is no doubt that an efficient submarine force
is a very formidable addition to our flotilla for coast
defence. Perhaps we thought, in those years of perpetual
preparation, too much about the ‘Invasion of
England’ and too little about the duty of supporting
our Allies on land; and we had this much justification,
that the Power from which we had every reason to
expect an attack, was one directed by men of great
energy and determination, certain to be relentless in
pressing a war home upon us, even at the risk of a heavy
loss. On the other hand, those who spoke and wrote
most about invasion, nearly always failed to realise
the immense difficulty of the undertaking; and they
failed especially to see that, in modern times, the conditions
had changed very considerably in favour of the
defence. The initial problem of an invader by sea
must always be the provision of transport sufficient
for a large body of troops, with arms, equipment, and
supplies of food and munitions. Even if we allow only
two tons of shipping per man&mdash;the Japanese allowed
six tons&mdash;the transport of 100,000 men would take
twenty vessels of 10,000 tons each, and to collect these
and load them would be a big operation; difficult to
conceal. In fact to conceal it, for a sufficiently long
time, from a defence force well supplied with wireless
telegraphy, fast scouts, and aerial observation, would
now be a practical impossibility. But even if we suppose
such an expedition to be able (under cover of
fog, or by a complete surprise) to cross the North Sea
unobserved, there remains the further difficulty of the
landing. A place must be found where the invaders<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71">71</a></span>
could obtain immediate control of supplies and communications;
there are but half a dozen such places
at most upon our eastern coast-line, and these are all
prepared for a strenuous defence by land. If we add
to the land defence a mine-field and the presence of
an unknown number of submarines, the attempt becomes
one involving the certainty of immense losses,
and the extreme probability of failure. Even the
German war-lords have not yet made up their minds
to the risk of seeing eight or ten divisions drowned
in an hour.</p>

<p>Besides coast defence and harbour attack, there
might possibly be a chance for our submarines in a
fleet action. Of that, all that can be said now is that
our Submarine Service is believed to have shown greater
promptness and ingenuity in its preparations than the
German Admiralty, and awaits the next naval engagement
with eager anticipation. But already it has been
found practicable to use our submarines for two very
important kinds of work, to an extent which was certainly
quite unforeseen. One of these is the chase and
destruction of enemy submarines&mdash;a kind of service
which has been pronounced impossible, even in books
written during the later stages of the War, but actual
examples of which will be given in one of the chapters
which describe our hunting methods. The other kind
of work is the blockade of the enemy’s shipping trade
and supply service, to be described when we come to the
account of our submarine campaigns in the Baltic and
Dardanelles.</p>

<p>If we turn now to German naval policy, we shall
come at once upon an interesting point, which has not
been generally understood. We have been told that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72">72</a></span>
the German Admiralty, before the War, was completely
deceived as to the value of the submarine. And Mr.
Marley Hay has been often quoted as saying that, in
several conversations in 1911, Admiral von Tirpitz
‘expressed emphatically his opinion that he considered
submarines to be in an experimental stage, of doubtful
utility, and that the German Government was not at
all convinced that they would form an essential or a
conspicuous part of their future naval programme.’
Mr. Hay shows clearly that this was not said with the
object of misleading; for he was urging Tirpitz to
build, and the Admiral continued to refuse. When war
broke out, the German Navy had only twenty-seven
submarines built against seventy-six British and seventy
French boats, and she was only building twelve more,
against the twenty and twenty-three on our side.
This may have been partly due to a miscalculation
of their efficiency; but the main reason was probably
that the directors of German war policy were (at that
time) preparing for a war in which our Navy was to
take no part. The account with England was to be
settled at a later date. The immediate intention was
to deal with France and Russia, and the assistance
of the Austrian and Italian submarines in the Mediterranean
was of course reckoned upon.</p>

<p>When war came these calculations were falsified.
The German High Seas Fleet found itself unable to stand
up to ours, and German war policy was forced to take
a different direction. The U-boats’ first allotted task
was the legitimate one of reducing our margin of superiority
in battle-ships and cruisers. While our Fleet was
certain to keep the sea, and protect our long coast-line
and huge merchant tonnage, the German High<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73">73</a></span>
Seas Fleet must lie in the Kiel Canal, risking only
furtive and futile rushes into the open. But if the U-boats
could hit a sufficient number of our more active
war-ships, they might bring the forces nearer to an
equality, and perhaps establish a prestige for their
own Service. How they failed in this attempt we
shall see presently.</p>

<p>When their failure in the game of attrition became
evident, the U-boats were utilised in a different way.
A submarine blockade of the British Isles was plainly
threatened by Admiral von Tirpitz towards the end
of 1914; and the official announcement of it was made
on February 4, 1915. By this document it was declared
that on and after February 18, every British or French
merchant vessel found in the waters of the ‘war region’
round these islands ‘will be destroyed, without its
always being possible to warn the crews or passengers
of the dangers threatening.’ Neutral ships, it was
added, would not be attacked unless by mistake; but
they are warned not to take the risk.</p>

<p>Those who know even a little of the history of our
old wars will see at a glance that this is a new move in
naval war policy, and one made by the Germans to
get over certain difficulties which arise from the very
nature of submarine boats, and which are especially
embarrassing when the submarines belong to a navy
decidedly inferior to its enemies at sea. The old and
well-established rules of naval war laid down that you
could only interfere with merchant shipping if it were
engaged in carrying contraband of war. To ascertain
whether the ship you had sighted was carrying contraband
or not, you had to board and search her. If
innocent, you must let her proceed on her voyage.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74">74</a></span>
If apparently guilty, you took over her men or otherwise
placed them in safety, put a prize crew on board and
sent her home to a port of your own, to be tried legally
by a properly constituted tribunal called a Prize Court.
If this Court decided that she was, in fact, carrying
contraband, she was your prize. If you were forced by
stress of circumstances to destroy the prize, instead of
sending her into port, you took every care to remove
everyone on board before doing so; and when you
had not room for so many people, you released the
prize rather than endanger or sacrifice the lives of
non-combatants.</p>

<p>All these humane rules could well be observed by
any ordinary cruiser; and they were, in fact, kept by
the <i>Emden</i> and other German cruisers when harrying
British commerce in the East. But it is obvious at the
first glance that a submarine would be continually in
difficulties over them. It would always be risky for
so fragile and unhandy a vessel to board and search a
big ship, which might prove to be armed with guns or
bombs. No submarine could find room for merchant
crews or passengers in her own small compartments,
and no submarine could afford to spare a prize crew
for even one prize, or the time and horse-power to tow
her into port. In short, it was plain, from the first,
that the legitimate cruiser game could not be played
at all by submarine boats. The Government of the
United States put the truth unanswerably in these
words: ‘The employment of submarines for the
destruction of enemy trade is of necessity completely
irreconcilable with the principles of humanity, with
the long existing undisputed rights of neutrals, and with
the sacred privileges of non-combatants.’</p>

The British Navy had an advantage here&mdash;the inestimable
advantage of a force that could keep the sea
against all its enemies. It was, therefore, possible for
our submarines to stop an occasional ship with impunity,
or to call up a destroyer and send a prize into port;
and in the narrow waters of the Baltic and the Sea of
Marmora, supply ships and merchantmen were captured
and destroyed by them with every regard for the laws
of humanity. But the German submarines had no
fleet at sea to back their attempted blockade, and
German war policy therefore took the downward
course, hacking a way through the rules, and sacrificing,
for the hope of victory, the very foundations of civilised
human life. The U-boats began by turning passengers
and crews adrift in open boats, no matter in what
weather or how far from land. They went on to sink
even great liners without search, and without warning;
and they came finally down to the destruction of
helpless men and women in boats, in order that the
ships they had torpedoed might disappear without a
trace&mdash;<i xml:lang="de" lang="de">spürlos versenkt</i>.</p>

<p>The use of the submarine for attacking war-ships is,
of course, perfectly legitimate, and the powers and
possibilities of this weapon were much discussed before
the War. Some writers of note believed that the day
of the big battleship was practically over&mdash;that such
vessels could be ‘pulled down’ with certainty by
any enterprising submarine commander, without any
corresponding risk to his own boat. Others, with
cooler or more scientific heads, maintained that there
is an answer to every weapon, and that the introduction
of submarines would not change the principles of war.
The result has shown that the latter school of opinion
was right. The submarine has achieved some striking
successes here and there against the larger ships of
war, but has not rendered them obsolete or kept them
from going about their true business, the control of
the sea; and as time goes on, it is rather the submarine
than the battle-ship which is found too vulnerable to
challenge a fight, when neither has the advantage of
surprise.</p>

<p>This legitimate use of the submarine formed part,
as we have seen, of both British and German war
policy&mdash;though, in our own case, it was originally considered
rather as a means of defence against invasion;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79">79</a></span>
than of offence on the high seas. It was, therefore,
not unnatural that the U-boat should score first.
Besides, we were offering a hundred targets to one.
Our cruisers were all over the North Sea, while no
German ships could be met there except an occasional
mine-layer like the <i>Königin Luise</i>. This state of
things has only become more invariable as the War has
developed; and the most remarkable result, so far, of
the contest between the two submarine services is the
practical equality of the score on the two sides. With
infinitely fewer and more difficult chances, the British
submarine has actually surpassed the U-boat’s record,
in successes obtained against enemy ships of war, and
immensely surpassed it in the proportion of successes
to opportunities.</p>

<p>The first war-ship to fall to the torpedo of a submarine
was the <i>Pathfinder</i>, a light cruiser of about
5,000 tons, with a complement of 268 officers and men,
of whom some half were saved. The boat which sank
her was the U.&nbsp;21, commanded by Lieutenant Hersing,
who raised high hopes in Germany which he was not
destined to fulfil.</p>

<p>A greater captain is said to have been Captain
Otto Weddigen, who achieved the sensational feat
of pulling down three of our cruisers in one hour, and
was supposed by some of his fellow-countrymen to
have solved the problem of reducing the British Fleet
to an equality with the German. But he owed more
to luck and our inexperience than to any peculiar skill
of his own. In the early morning of September 22,
1914, he stalked the armoured cruisers <i>Aboukir</i>, <i>Hogue</i>,
and <i>Cressy</i>, old ships of 12,000 tons and 18 knots’ speed,
which were out on patrol duty in the North Sea, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80">80</a></span>
were about to take up their stations for the day’s work.
The danger of the submarine was hardly yet fully
recognised; and when the <i>Aboukir</i> was struck by a
violent explosion, the general belief in the squadron
was that she had run foul of a mine. She listed heavily
and sank slowly, her funnels almost level with the
water, and the smoke coming out as from the water’s
edge. The other two ships closed her at once, and
had got within two cables of her when the <i>Hogue</i> was
struck in turn by two torpedoes almost simultaneously.
The effect was extraordinary. ‘She seemed,’ says an
eye-witness, ‘to give one jump out of the water and
then to go straight down.’ So quickly did she go,
that she was out of sight long before <i>Aboukir</i>, who
took twenty minutes to sink, so that her men (as one
of them said) ‘got time to do the best.’</p>

<p>The moment the <i>Hogue</i> was struck, it was realised
that submarines were at work, and <i>Cressy</i> opened fire
from one of her 9·2-in. guns. She was hit herself by
two torpedoes immediately afterwards, and listed
heavily, so that everything began to roll down the deck.
But she sank slowly and her gunners kept up their fire
most gallantly, giving up their chance of being saved
for the hope of killing their enemy before they went
down. They fired a dozen shots in all, and are said by
Lieutenant Harrison to have sunk one of the attacking
U-boats. ‘I reckon her gunners,’ said a survivor from
the <i>Aboukir</i>, ‘were about the bravest men that ever
lived. They kept up the firing until she had 40 degrees
of list. They died gamely, did those fellows.’ Their
shipmates were worthy of them. ‘There was absolutely
no panic on the cruiser; the men were as calm as at
drill.’ At last some trawlers came up; and, after two<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81">81</a></span>
hours, some destroyers. Only 777 of the three ships’
crews were saved, out of a total of about 2,100; and
60 officers were lost out of 120. ‘Some of our men
must have been in the water for three or four hours.
The <i>Aboukir</i> men were taken to the <i>Hogue</i>; when the
<i>Hogue</i> was sunk, they were taken to the <i>Cressy</i>; when
the <i>Cressy</i> was taken, they were thrown in the sea again.
Yet here they are, and there is only one thing they
want&mdash;to go to sea again and have another whack at
the men who torpedoed them.’</p>

<p>Possibly they had their wish; for some of them may
have been on board the British ship which, a few months
later, destroyed U.&nbsp;29 (Weddigen’s boat) by a brilliant
and almost reckless feat of seamanship, which, in later
days, will form a favourite yarn of the Service.</p>

<p>The only other war-ship lost by submarine action in
1914 was the <i>Hawke</i>, an armoured cruiser twenty-five
years old, which was torpedoed while on patrol in
the North Sea, and sank in ten minutes, only seventy
of those on board being saved. The year 1915 began
badly for us, and ended by being decidedly our worst
year on one side the account, though it was our best
on the other. At 2 o’clock in the morning of January 1,
a squadron of battle-ships, of the older types of 1901 and
1902, was steaming down Channel in line ahead. There
was a gale blowing, and the sea was running high. The
last two ships of the line were the <i>London</i> and the
<i>Formidable</i>, the latter of which was suddenly shaken
by a violent explosion, and not long afterwards by a
second one. Even then, the ship did not sink till
forty-five minutes after; and if it had not been for the
rough weather and icy water, boats and rafts might
have been got away with most of the crew. As it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82">82</a></span>
was, no steam-pinnaces could be got out, and the oars
of the 42-foot cutter and other boats were nearly all
smashed against the ship’s sides. The whole company,
from the officers, giving quiet orders on the bridge, to
the men smoking on the slant deck, behaved as if at
manœuvres, and Captain Loxley, who went down with
his ship, distinguished himself by signalling to the
<i>London</i> not to stand by him, as there was a submarine
about. One boat came ashore at Lyme Regis, with
forty-six live men and nine dead in her; seventy more
men were brought in after three hours’ hard and
dangerous work by the 50-ton smack, <i>Provident</i>, of Brixham&mdash;William
Pillar, skipper. His crew consisted of
three men and a cook-boy. Out of a total complement
of more than 700, only 201 were saved in all. Among
the lost were thirty-four officers, including eight midshipmen
and a sub-lieutenant.</p>

<p>On March 11, the <i>Bayano</i>, an armed merchant-cruiser,
was torpedoed off the Firth of Clyde, and went down
with 170 of her 200 men. On April 11, the <i>Wayfarer</i>
transport was torpedoed, and ran ashore off Queenstown.
On May 1, the <i>Recruit</i>, a small torpedo-boat
of 385 tons, was sunk in the North Sea, with thirty-nine
out of her sixty-four officers and men.</p>

  <div class="caption">‘Were brought in by the 50-ton smack, <i>Provident</i>, of Brixham.’</div></div>

<p>Then came two grave losses on two consecutive
days. The British Fleet off Gallipoli had already lost
the <i>Irresistible</i> and <i>Ocean</i> by floating mines; and now
the U-boats succeeded in inflicting another double loss
on us, at a moment when the Army needed the strongest
support to ensure success. On May 26, a single torpedo
sank the <i>Triumph</i>, while she was co-operating with the
Australian and New Zealand troops before Ari Burnu.
She was accompanied by an escort of two destroyers, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83">83</a><a class="hidev" id="Page_84">84</a><br /><a class="hidev" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
was about to open fire when the submarine got a shot
into her. She listed till her deck touched the water,
and in five minutes capsized completely, but remained
floating for twenty minutes, keel upwards. Some 460
of the officers and men were saved.</p>

<p>The <i>Triumph</i> was not designed for our Navy, but
taken over from the builder’s yard, and the curious
arch formed by her derricks made her outline a conspicuously
foreign feature in our Fleet. The <i>Majestic</i>,
on the other hand, which quickly followed her to
destruction, was a typically British vessel, and gave
her name to the whole class, built in 1895 and the
following years, and then greatly admired. She also,
on May 27, was supporting the army in action on the
Gallipoli peninsula, when a German torpedo ended her
twenty years’ career. She carried about 760 officers
and men, but nearly all of them were saved. In June,
two torpedo-boats, the <i>Greenfly</i> and <i>Mayfly</i>, of 215
tons, were sunk; the <i>Roxburgh</i>, a 10,000-ton cruiser,
was slightly damaged; and the <i>Lightning</i> torpedo-boat,
of 275 tons, was disabled, but brought into harbour.
On August 8, a U-boat sank one of our large auxiliary
cruisers, the <i>India</i>, off the coast of Norway and in
Norwegian territorial waters. By this breach of the
rules, she succeeded in killing 10 officers and 150 men,
out of a complement of over 300.</p>

<p>The losses so far enumerated were all strictly naval
losses. Up to this time, although we had been transporting
troops by the hundred thousand from Canada
and Australia to England, and from England to France,
India, Mesopotamia, Egypt, and Gallipoli, our numbers
had hardly suffered the smallest diminution by submarine
action. Again, during the last three years<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86">86</a></span>
(1916&ndash;18) we have had minor losses now and then; but
the one and only real disaster of this kind came upon
us in 1915. On August 14, the British transport, the
<i>Royal Edward</i>, was in the Ægean, carrying reinforcements
for the 29th Division in Gallipoli, and details
of the Royal Army Medical Corps, when she was torpedoed
by a German submarine and sank rapidly.
She had on board 32 military officers and 1,350 troops,
in addition to her own crew of 220 officers and men.
Of all these, only 600 were saved; and for the first time
in modern war we suffered the cruel loss of soldiers to
the strength of a whole battalion killed&mdash;not in battle, but
helpless and unresisting, without the chance of firing a
shot or delivering a last charge with the bayonet. The
ship herself was a less harrowing loss; but she was a fine
vessel that we could ill spare&mdash;a steel triple-screw steamer
of 11,117 tons and 545 feet in length. She, like her sister
ship, the <i>Royal George</i>, was originally built for the
Egyptian Mail Steamship Company, and ran between
Marseilles and Alexandria. Her later service was carrying
the mails for the Canadian Northern Steamship
Company between Avonmouth and Montreal&mdash;and now
she had returned to Eastern waters, only to give an
isolated and inconclusive triumph to a desperate enemy.</p>

<p>The remainder of the year saw many attempts by
the U-boat commanders to repeat this success; but
they mostly ended in failure. On September 2, the
transport <i>Southland</i> was hit by a torpedo, but got into
Madras under her own steam, with a loss of 30 men
killed in the explosion. On September 19, the <i>Ramazan</i>,
with 385 Indian troops on board, was shelled and sunk
by a submarine, off Antikythera. In October, the transport
<i>Marquette</i> was sunk in the Ægean. On November 3,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87">87</a></span>
the transport <i>Mercian</i> was heavily shelled, and had
nearly 100 killed and wounded. On November 5
the <i>Tara</i>, armed boarding-steamer, was sunk in the
Bay of Sollum, on the eastern border of Egypt; and
immediately afterwards two small Customs cruisers&mdash;the
<i>Prince Abbas</i> of 300 tons and the <i>Abdul Moneim</i>
of 450&mdash;were sunk at the same place, and no doubt by
the same pair of U-boats.</p>

<p>The year 1916 showed clearly that, as a weapon
against armed ships, the U-boat was not likely to
succeed, after the first period of surprise was past.
During this year we lost three mine-sweepers&mdash;<i>Primula</i>,
<i>Clacton</i>, and <i>Genista</i>; two empty transports&mdash;the
<i>Russian</i> and <i>Franconia</i>; the <i>Zaida</i> and <i>Duke of Albany</i>,
armed steamers of the auxiliary patrol; and one
destroyer, the <i>Lassoo</i>, which was sunk with a loss of
six men, either by mine or torpedo, off the coast of
Holland. To this insignificant list must be added one
disaster of a more serious kind. As we have already
noted, our control of the North Sea was a continuous
and effective control, and every effort was made,
especially after the flight of the Germans from Jutland,
to bring out the enemy fleet from its hiding-place.
These efforts, of course, involved the exposure of our
advanced forces to certain risks. On August 19, there
was a report that the High Canal Fleet was at
sea again. Hope outstripped belief, and light cruisers
were sent out in every direction to find the enemy.
Two of these, the <i>Nottingham</i> and the <i>Falmouth</i>&mdash;good
ships of 5,400 and 5,250 tons&mdash;were torpedoed and
sunk while scouting. Here again it was the loss of the
men which we felt most. The ships were new and useful
ones; but they could be replaced, and they belonged<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88">88</a></span>
to a class in which the enemy’s force, since the battle
of Jutland, had been deficient, almost to a disabling
degree. There was no ground for the German hope
that our naval superiority could be permanently
whittled away by rare and fractional losses like these.
Our Battle Fleet continued to hold up theirs, and our
blockade of their coasts was in no degree weakened.</p>

<p>The record of 1917, and the first half of 1918, is
even more significant. The German submarine effort
was more and more completely diverted from legitimate
to illegitimate war&mdash;from the attack on the enemy’s
armed forces, to the destruction of non-combatants and
neutrals in mercantile shipping of any kind. British
destroyers, going everywhere, facing every kind of
risk, and protecting everyone before themselves, now
and again furnished an item to the German submarine
bag; but the ‘regardless’ campaign against the world’s
trade and the world’s tonnage was now the U-boats’
chief occupation. One legitimate objective they did
still set before themselves&mdash;the destruction or hindrance
of transport for the United States army between the
shores of America and Europe. Again and again
during 1917, and even in the earlier days of 1918,
assurances were given to the German people by Admiral
von Tirpitz, by Admiral von Capelle, by the Prussian
Minister of Finance in the Diet, and by the chief military
writers in the Press, that the promise of an American
army was a boast and a deception, that the American
troops could not and would not cross the Atlantic,
because of the triumphant activity of the U-boats.
Of the complete failure to make good these assurances
no better account need be given than that supplied
by the German Admiralty, in answer to the complaints<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89">89</a></span>
of their own people. Towards the end of July 1918,
when there was no longer any possibility of concealing
the presence of a large and victorious American force
in France, Admiral von Holtzendorff, the Admiralty
Chief of Staff, gave the following explanation to the
<i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Kölnische Zeitung</i>. He admitted the success of the
Allies in improving oversea transport, especially the
transport of troops from America. But in reply to
the statement that there was in Germany much disappointment
that the submarines had sunk so few of
the American transports, he asked, with truly Prussian
effrontery, how <em>could</em> submarines be specially employed
against American transports. ‘The Americans,’ he
said, ‘have at their disposition, for disembarkation,
the coasts from the North of Scotland to the French
Mediterranean ports, with dozens of landing-places.
Ought we to let our submarines lie in wait before these
ports, to see whether they can possibly get a shot at
a strongly protected American transport, escorted by
fast convoying vessels? The convoys do not arrive
with the regularity and frequency of railway trains
at a great station, but irregularly, at great intervals of
time, and often at night or in a fog. Taking all this
into consideration, it is evident how little prospect of
success is offered for the special employment of submarines
against American transports.’</p>

<p>This is all sound enough, and in fact the U-boats
have only succeeded in killing 126 men out of the first
million landed from America. But the argument of
Admiral von Holtzendorff does not explain the official
assurances by which the German public was deceived
for more than a year, and it only partially explains
the ill success of the U-boats. That could only be fully<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90">90</a></span>
done by considering the offensive (or offensive-defensive)
action of war-ship against submarine&mdash;which will
be touched upon presently.</p>

<p>The record of the ‘bag’ made during the War by
our own submarines has never yet been published in
a complete form. Yet it is a most striking one, and
ought effectually to remove any impression that the
German Submarine Service is in any way superior&mdash;or
even equal&mdash;to ours. In three years of war our
boats sank over 300 enemy vessels. We lost, of course,
many more; but when it is remembered that we were
offering to our enemies every week more than four
times as many targets as they offered us during the
whole three years, it will be admitted that the comparison
is not one to give them much ground for satisfaction.
At present, however, this general comparison
is not the one which we wish to make&mdash;we are concerned
now with attacks on war-ships, or armed forces, and
not on mercantile shipping. The greater part of our
record is made up of such attacks, and it is now possible
to give a short summary of them.</p>

<p>There have been, during this War, practically only
three hunting-grounds where British submarines could
hope to meet with enemy war-ships, transports, or supply
ships. These are the North Sea, the Baltic, and the
Dardanelles or Sea of Marmora. Of the work done
by our submarines in the Baltic and Dardanelles we
shall have separate accounts to give in later chapters.
For the present, it is enough to tabulate the results.
In the Baltic the bag included, besides a large number
of steamers (some carrying iron ore for military use),
the following war-ships: three destroyers, three transports,
one old battleship or cruiser, one light cruiser,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91">91</a></span>
and one armed auxiliary. In the Dardanelles or Sea
of Marmora were sunk or destroyed the following,
besides a very large number of ships with stores or
provisions for the troops in Gallipoli: two battle-ships,
four gun-boats, one armed German auxiliary, seven
transports, three ammunition ships and one ammunition
train, destroyed by gunfire. We may add, as a note
to these two parts of our record, that the work was
done, not by a large number of submarines issuing
in relays from a home base close at hand, and equipped
with every kind of facility for repairing defects or
relieving tired crews, but by an almost incredibly
small number of boats, working far from their base,
in closed waters, and under difficulties such as no
German boat has ever successfully attempted to
face.</p>

<p>There remains the North Sea patrol. The first success
in this record stands against a famous name&mdash;that
of Commander Max Horton, who (in his boat E.&nbsp;9)
afterwards established what has been called ‘The
Command of the Baltic.’ In September 13, 1914, he
was in the North Sea, near to enemy forces. He was
submerged, and not in the happiest of circumstances,
for one of his officers was ill, and to afford him some
relief from the exhausted atmosphere below, it became
imperatively necessary to rise to the surface. No
sooner was the periscope above water, than the commander
sighted a German light cruiser, the <i>Héla</i>, in a
position where she might be expected to see the periscope
and attack at any moment. Fortunately a torpedo-tube
was loaded and bearing. Commander Horton
took a snap-shot and dived. The shot went home, and
the <i>Héla</i> troubled the patrol of E.&nbsp;9 no more. On<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92">92</a></span>
October 6, a German destroyer (S.&nbsp;116) fell to another
shot from the same hand.</p>

<p>After this, game was much scarcer. The German
Admiralty tried to establish a paper command of the
North Sea, kept up (for the benefit of the German public)
by runaway raids on our East Coast towns; but anything
like a regular patrol was impossible to discover.
In the following eighteen months, however, our submarines
did succeed in two attacks on stray German
destroyers, and four on armed auxiliary vessels. Lieut.-Commander
Benning (E.&nbsp;5) hit an auxiliary in April
1915, but did not sink her. In June, Lieut.-Commander
Moncrieffe hit another, the <i>America</i>, so badly that she
was run ashore. In September, Commander Benning
sank a third outright; and in December, Lieut.-Commander
Duff-Dunbar (E.&nbsp;16) secured a larger one of
3,000 tons. Of the destroyers, the first (V.&nbsp;188) was
got by Commander C.&nbsp;P. Talbot, in E.&nbsp;16, on July 26;
and the second on February 4, 1916, by Lieut.-Commander
H.&nbsp;W. Shove, in E.&nbsp;29. This was a boat of the
‘S.&nbsp;138’ class, but she could not be further identified,
nor did any British eye actually witness her final
disappearance.</p>

<p>The rest of the bag is, for the most part, a forbidden
subject. The items are many, the loss to the enemy
was great; but as he is racking his brains to get or guess
the details, it is no part of our business to help him.
There are, however, two items of which we may speak
with open satisfaction. One is the capture of a German
trawler&mdash;of this we have already heard from the Admiral
Commanding our Submarine Base, in Chapter IV.
The simple story is that Lieut.-Commander G. Kellett,
finding his boat (S.&nbsp;1) so far disabled that she could not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93">93</a></span>
get home on her own engines, took over a German
trawler by force, without attracting undue attention,
and came safely into port, towed from enemy waters
by an enemy boat. The remaining item hardly falls
within our range; but though not submarine work,
it is work actually done by a submarine, and may be
classed, perhaps, with the destruction of the ammunition
train by Lieut.-Commander Cochrane at Yarandji.
On May 4, 1916, a Zeppelin (L.&nbsp;7) fell to Lieut.-Commander
F.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;B. Feilman, in E.&nbsp;31, and he brought
home seven of her crew as prisoners.</p>

<p>Even this is not all. In 1916, our submarines
inflicted on the German Fleet itself four blows, which,
though they were none of them actually fatal, must yet
have been extremely damaging to the nerve of the
Service, and certainly cost heavily for repairs both in
time and labour. On August 19, the <i>Westfalen</i>&mdash;a
battle-ship of 18,000 tons, built in 1908&mdash;was torpedoed
by Lieut.-Commander Turner, in E.&nbsp;23. On October 19,
Lieut.-Commander Jessop severely damaged the light
cruiser <i>München</i>, of 3,200 tons; and on November 5,
Commander Lawrence (in J.&nbsp;1) achieved the brilliant
feat of torpedoing two German Dreadnoughts&mdash;the
<i>Grosser Kurfurst</i>, which was laid down in 1913 and
finished since the War began, and the <i>Kronprinz</i>, which
was both laid down and commissioned since August
1914. A success of this kind, though not final, may
well be set against the sinking of much older and more
vulnerable ships, like the <i>Formidable</i>, <i>Triumph</i>, and
<i>Majestic</i>; and it must be remembered that the disappearance
of these three from our Navy List, however
regrettable, had absolutely no effect on the relative
strength of the British and German Battle Fleets;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94">94</a></span>
whereas the loss, for some months at any rate, of two
great Dreadnoughts like the <i>Grosser Kurfurst</i> and
<i>Kronprinz</i>&mdash;coming as it did shortly after the Jutland
losses&mdash;carried the inferiority of Admiral von Scheer’s
force to the point of impotence. In the match of
submarine against war-ship, our boats had succeeded
where the U-boats had signally failed.</p>

</div>

<p>The story of the contest between our war-ships and their
new enemy, the submarine, is the story of a most remarkable
and successful adaptation. Of the six principal
methods of defence used by our Navy at the end of the
fourth year of war, three are old and three new; and
it is a striking proof of the scientific ability of the Service,
that the three old methods have been carefully reconsidered,
and that, instead of abandoning them because,
in their original use, they were apparently obsolete, our
officers have turned them to even better account than
the new inventions.</p>

<p>The oldest device for the protection of war-ships
against torpedoes&mdash;whether fired by torpedo-boats or
submarines&mdash;is the net. Our older battle-ships, as
everyone will remember, were fitted with a complete
set of steel nets on both sides, and with long booms for
hanging them out. These booms, when not in use, were
lashed diagonally along the ship’s sides, like great
stitches, and gave the typical vessels of the British Fleet
a peculiar and decidedly smart appearance. Very
smart, too, was the quickness and precision with which the
order ‘Out torpedo nets!’ was executed; but&mdash;long before
1914&mdash;everyone was perfectly aware that the nets were
practically as much out of date as masts and sails.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96">96</a></span>
They were so heavy, and hung so low in the water, that no
ship could manœuvre in them, and even for a fleet at
anchor they had ceased to be a trustworthy defence;
for the Whitehead torpedo was now fitted with cutters
which could shear a way through the steel meshes.</p>

<p>Nets of the old type, therefore, have played no part
in the present War&mdash;unless we are to believe the Turkish
account of the sinking of the <i>Ocean</i> in the Dardanelles,
according to which the nets were out, and were not only
useless as a protection, but dragged down some of our men
when they might otherwise have escaped by swimming.
But, because one type of net is obsolete, the British
Navy has seen no reason to reject all nets as impracticable.
It is not beyond imagination to conceive a net
so light and large of mesh, that it will diminish by no
more than one knot the speed of the ship which carries
it, and will yet catch and deflect a torpedo in the act
of passing through it. For it must be remembered that
the real problem is not how to stop a torpedo in its
full 30-knot career, but how to prevent it from striking
the ship with its head at an angle not too fine for the
detonator to be fired. A turn of the helm, or the mere
wave from the cut-water of a fast ship, has often sent
a torpedo running harmlessly away along the quarter.
The net of the future may be found equally successful in
catching the fish by its whiskers and turning it forward
along the bow, where the same wave will drive it outwards
from the ship’s course.</p>

<p>The second familiar means of defence was the gun.
Here again there was a temptation to despair. The
secondary armament of any battle-ship or cruiser was
fairly certain to make short work of a torpedo-boat, or
of a submarine visible upon the surface. But no living<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97">97</a></span>
gunner had ever fired at the periscope of a submarine&mdash;a
mark only two feet, at most, out of the water, and only
four inches in diameter. To see such an object at,
say, 1,000 yards, was difficult; to hit it might well seem
impossible. Yet 1,000 yards was but one-tenth of the
possible range at which a modern submarine might
fire its torpedo.</p>

<p>Nevertheless the use of the gun was not discarded;
and two important discoveries were made in consequence.
The first of these was that gunfire may be
distant, wild, or even unaimed, and yet have an excellent
effect. The existence of a submarine is so precarious&mdash;its
chance of surviving a single direct hit is so slight&mdash;that
the mere sound of a gun will almost always be
enough to make it submerge completely&mdash;unless it can
engage the enemy, with superior gun-power, at a range
of its own choosing. When Captain Weddigen had
already hit the <i>Aboukir</i>, the <i>Hogue</i>, and the <i>Cressy</i>,
and all three were sinking, the sound of the <i>Cressy’s</i>
guns was enough to cause his disappearance, though it
is very improbable that the shooting was really dangerous;
for the listing of the ship was rapid, and according
to eye-witnesses, the gallant gunners were soon firing in
the air. Since then, the same thing has been repeatedly
observed; and some brilliant successes by our patrol-boats
and trawlers have shown that the U-boat has
every right to be nervous when it hears even a 6-pounder
talking English.</p>

<p>The other discovery is a much more recent one. As
soon as it was once recognised that a torpedo is just
as innocuous when deflected, as when stopped or evaded,
the idea was sure to strike the handiest gunners in the
world that they might use their weapons to disturb the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98">98</a></span>
straightforwardness of the fish’s onset. Even thirty
knots is nothing to the velocity of a modern shell,
and without hoping for a direct hit on an object from
six to twenty-two feet under water, it was thought
possible to give a twist to the torpedo’s nose sufficient
to make a potential hit into a miss or a glancing shot.
This feat was actually performed by the gunners of
the <i>Justitia</i>, who, with splendid coolness, shot at torpedoes
as sportsmen used to shoot at oncoming tigers,
and succeeded in killing or diverting several, only to
fall at last before the rush of numbers.</p>

  <div class="caption">‘She had gone full speed for the enemy, and rammed him.’</div></div>

<p>A third weapon of the war-ship was the ram; and
the use of this, being an offensive-defensive method,
was the best of all, as we shall see presently. It was,
from the beginning, present to the mind of every naval
man, for A.&nbsp;1 (our very first submarine) was lost, with all
hands, in May, 1904, by being accidentally rammed in
the act of submerging. It happened, too, that the first
attack made by a submarine against British war-ships
in the present War was beaten by this method. On
August 9, 1914, a squadron of our light cruisers sighted
the periscope of a German U-boat, which had succeeded
in approaching to within short range of them. In the
account of the affair published at the time, we were
informed that H.M.S. <i>Birmingham</i> had sunk the
submarine by a direct hit on the periscope, and that
this was the only shot fired. Some time afterwards,
the truth became known&mdash;the <i>Birmingham</i> had to her
credit, not an impossible feat of gunnery, but a brilliant
piece of seamanship. She had gone full speed for the
enemy, and rammed him. Her captain was not led to
do this by inspiration or desperation, but by a scientific
knowledge of the elements in the problem. Without<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99">99</a><a class="hidev" id="Page_100">100</a><br /><a class="hidev" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
stopping to think afresh, he knew that a submarine
takes a certain time to dive to a safe depth, and that
his own ship, at 27 knots, would cover a good 900 yards
of sea in one minute. When his eye measured the
distance of that periscope, he saw that&mdash;given straight
steering&mdash;the result was a mathematical certainty.</p>

<p>The new methods introduced during the War are also
three in number. Of one&mdash;the use of dazzle-painting&mdash;we
have already heard. It is, of course, a purely defensive
measure, intended to deceive the eye at the periscope
by misrepresenting the ship’s size, distance, and course.
Another deceptive device is the phantom ship or dummy.
A vessel of comparatively small size and value is covered
more or less completely with a superstructure of light
wood-work, with sham funnels, turrets and big guns, so
that she has all the appearance of a battle-cruiser or
Dreadnought. The U-boat may run after her, or run
from her, according to his feeling at the moment; but,
in either case, he will be wasting his time and laying up
disappointment for himself. In May, 1915, during the
Gallipoli campaign, the Germans spent a certain amount
of time and trouble in torpedoing a ship which they
supposed to be H.M.S. <i>Agamemnon</i>, and in their illustrated
propaganda sheets they give a picture of that
ship as one of the victims of the irresistible U-boats.
For a short time the story was believed inside Constantinople,
and Mr. Lewis Einstein, of the American Embassy
there, relates in his diary that this success, coming (as
it appeared to do) immediately after the sinking of the
<i>Triumph</i> and <i>Majestic</i>, was almost more than he could
bear. Fortunately for his peace of mind, he soon
discovered the truth. The supposed <i>Agamemnon</i> was
a dummy, and lay for some time near the entrance of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102">102</a></span>
the Dardanelles, with her false turrets and sham guns,
exposed to the view of friends and foes on the two shores.
Very possibly this dummy received a shot which might
otherwise have been successfully directed against a
genuine battle-ship, and the deception was thus really
useful. The German cunning is expended in a very
different direction. Its object is often to deceive their
own people as to what has actually been lost, not to
avert a possible loss at our hands. Thus when the
super-submarine <i>Bremen</i> was sunk on her outward
voyage for America, one dummy <i>Bremen</i> after another
was ostentatiously brought home to a German port,
as if returning from a successful Atlantic passage. A
more flagrant instance still was the statement that,
among the German losses in the Battle of Jutland, was
the sinking of the <i>Pommern</i>, a small and obsolete battle-ship
of 13,000 tons, built in 1905. The British
Admiralty, who knew that that older <i>Pommern</i> had
been sunk in the Baltic by Commander Max Horton,
nearly a year before, had no difficulty in identifying
the <i>Pommern</i> lost at Jutland with a new Dreadnought of
the largest type, commissioned since her predecessor’s
destruction and christened by her name&mdash;either then or
at the moment when it became necessary to put a good
face on their disasters in the battle. It is to be hoped
that this state of things may continue on both sides.
The Germans are welcome to our phantom ships, if we
thereby save our real ones; while, if we can sink their
real ones, we may well be content to hear them given
imaginary names. The two Services have different
ideas of what is a useful dummy.</p>

<p>The newest method of preserving ships from the
torpedo is a purely constructional device, and very little<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103">103</a></span>
can be said of it here. But we have been allowed to
know this much&mdash;the <i>Marlborough</i> was torpedoed at
Jutland, but returned to the line of battle within nine
minutes, fought for three hours, and eventually came
home under her own steam, defeating a submarine attack
on the way. We are not told how this very satisfactory
result is attained in the construction of a Dreadnought
of 25,000 tons, capable of full battle-ship speed. It
cannot be by the mere addition of the bulging compartments
known as ‘blisters,’ for in the older cruisers in
which these were tried they were found to cause too
great a sacrifice of speed. The result, however, is there;
and there can be no doubt that as the number of unsinkable
ships increases, the activity of the U-boat will be
very greatly discouraged.</p>

<p>But it would be contrary to the principles of war and
the genius of our Navy, to rely upon purely defensive
measures to defeat the submarine enemy. It is sometimes
said that the U-boat campaign took us by surprise.
So far as this applies to the legitimate use of the submarine
against war-ships, the statement is quite untrue.
The campaign against merchant shipping and non-combatant
passengers, waged in defiance of all international
law and common humanity, did certainly take
us by surprise; and it is only to our credit, and the
discredit of our enemies, that their barbarity was beyond
our imagination. But the efforts of the U-boats against
our fleet were, as we have shown in a previous chapter,
actually less successful than our own attacks upon
theirs, and our tacticians were never for a moment at
a loss to deal with them. The principles had been
thought out long ago. As early as 1907, the distinguished
admiral who writes over the name ‘Barfleur’<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104">104</a></span>
clearly stated his belief that ‘the untried submarine’
was not likely to prove more effective than the torpedo-boat
and destroyer in depriving our Battle Fleet of the
control of the sea. ‘Nothing is more to be deprecated,’
he added, ‘than the attempt which has been made to
enhance unduly its importance, by playing on the
credulity of the public. The new instrument of war
has no doubt a value, but that it is anything more than
an auxiliary, with limited and special uses, is difficult
to believe.’ And he turned back to old and tried principles:
‘The traditional role of the British Navy is not
to act on the defensive, but to prepare to attack the
force which threatens.’ In September, 1914, when
Weddigen’s <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">coup</i> showed that the moment had come,
‘Barfleur’ was among the first to attack the new problem
tactically&mdash;he saw at once that the war-ship’s best
defence lies in the offensive power given by her immense
superiority in speed and weight. And if the single ship
is formidable to the submarine, a squadron is still more
so. By its formation, its manœuvres, its pace and its
ramming power, it reverses the whole situation&mdash;the
hunter becomes the hunted, and must fly like a wolf
from a pack of wolf-hounds, every one more powerful
than itself.</p>

<p>There remains, of course, the question of the best
formation for the squadron to adopt. Upon this point
there are more opinions than one, and a conversation
may be reported in which the merits of line abreast and
line ahead were set against one another by two naval
officers, and both put out of court by a third. The first
two were captains commanding ships in two different
squadrons. They argued the question between them
with great seriousness; but in so cool and abstract a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105">105</a></span>
manner, that the spectator might be pardoned for suspecting&mdash;rightly
or wrongly&mdash;that they were supporting
doctrines which were not personal to themselves but
derived from higher authority&mdash;perhaps from their
respective admirals, both men of great ability and
experience. It was noticeable, too, that the admiral
at whose table the disputants were sitting, and who
himself commanded yet another squadron, maintained
an attitude of neutrality; though it is certain that he
and his own officers, several of whom were present, had
often discussed the problem, and were probably agreed
upon the answer to it.</p>

<p>‘Speed,’ said Captain A, ‘seems to be the key to
the solution. It is only in line ahead that speed helps
you&mdash;in fact gives you something like practical safety.
If a torpedo, fired at a column in line ahead, misses the
ship it is aimed at, it is very unlikely to be so wide a
shot as to hit either the next ahead or next astern&mdash;it
is a miss directly it crosses the line.’</p>

<p>Captain B remained perfectly grave, but he looked
very well content with this argument. ‘Yes,’ he said,
‘theoretically; but, in fact, the contrary has happened.
In a column of eight ships, in line ahead, the <i>London</i>
and the <i>Formidable</i> were the last two. You remember
that the torpedo which sank the <i>Formidable</i> was believed
to have been meant for the <i>London</i>. And anyhow,
speed and stormy weather failed to save the rear
ship.’</p>

<p>‘The speed was insufficient,’ replied Captain A,
‘not worth calling speed. When your fleet is in line
abreast, columns disposed astern, the theoretical chances
of hitting are much greater. Speed is no advantage in
such a formation&mdash;in fact it may be a positive disadvantage.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106">106</a></span>
It may actually increase the virtual target.
A shot which misses the near ship of a line abreast may
still hit one of the others.’</p>

<p>‘Laurence,’ said Captain B, ‘when he fired at the
<i>Moltke</i>, considered her, as wing ship of the squadron, to
be his only chance.’</p>

<p>‘There was no second line disposed astern,’ replied
Captain A; ‘but even so, if his torpedo had just missed,
ahead of the <i>Moltke</i>, the next or next but one in the
line might have come forward just in time to receive
the shot.’</p>

<p>‘That,’ said Captain B, ‘is a mere question of time
and distance; and, in anything like ordinary circumstances,
you would not get your result. Say the ships
are three cables apart, and doing only fifteen knots.
The torpedo is going double the speed; but by the time
it has run the three cables along the line, the next ship
will have gone one and a half cables ahead and be past
the danger point.’</p>

<p>‘Your ship may be zigzagging,’ replied Captain A,
‘and run right into it. Line ahead has the advantage
there&mdash;in fact, speaking generally, I have the power,
which you have not, of immediate deployment in any
direction. I can avoid mines, or turn away from the
submarine altogether.’</p>

<p>‘Certainly,’ said Captain B, looking again quite
well content, ‘but you would not turn away in any
case&mdash;you would best defend yourself by attacking the
submarine.’</p>

<p>Captain A hesitated a moment. ‘Yes,’ he replied
at last, ‘but in line abreast your attack might be positively
dangerous to yourself. Suppose your columns
in line abreast to be zigzagging, as they probably would<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107">107</a></span>
be, and imagine one of your ships to put her helm the
wrong way&mdash;there would inevitably be a collision.’</p>

<p>‘I cannot imagine such a thing,’ said Captain B.</p>

<p>‘I appeal to the Admiral,’ said Captain A.</p>

<p>It seemed an embarrassing thing, for a host and
superior officer, to be called upon to give judgment
between his guests on so serious an argument. But
the Admiral was not in the least embarrassed. He did
not even express his own opinion, which was thought
to favour Captain B. ‘Let me remind you,’ he said,
‘that you have not examined the most important
witness in the case&mdash;the commander of the submarine.
What order is the most dangerous for the submarine to
meet? I asked Commander C, one of our best E-boat
officers, this question lately, and he replied “Quarter-line,
undoubtedly.”’</p>

<p>He turned to the only landsman present, and reminded
him that in a quarter-line, or bow-and-quarter
line, the ships are echeloned each upon the quarter of
the next ahead instead of directly astern. He added,
‘A will say that this is in his favour, because ships in a
quarter-line are really in line ahead, only that each one
in turn is a little out of the straight. And B will claim
that he wins, because a quarter-line is merely a line
abreast in which each ship lags a little more behind the
true front. And C will tell us that the only thing
which matters is that the quarter-line gives the unhappy
submarine less chance of hitting, and more chance of
being sunk than either of the other two formations.
And thereupon the Court is adjourned.’</p>

<span class="subhead">BRITISH SUBMARINES IN THE BALTIC</span></h2>
</div>

<p>The story of our submarine campaign in the Baltic is
the first of two romances of the sea&mdash;one Northern and
one Southern&mdash;the like of which is not to be found in
the annals of the last 300 years. War must often make
us familiar with obscure or long-forgotten places, the
scenes of old voyages, and battles long ago; but to
adventure with our submarines into the Baltic, or the
Sea of Marmora, is to slip through unimagined dangers
into a legendary world beyond all history&mdash;sailing the
seas of the past, with the captains of the future. The
exploration under water of those intricate and perilous
channels was alone a discovery of supreme skill and
daring; and the brilliant acts of war achieved by the
adventurers form only a minor part of the glory of
being there at all.</p>

<p>The first of our submarine voyagers in the Baltic
was Lieut.-Commander Max Horton, in E.&nbsp;9. Before
the War was a year old his fame had spread far and
wide; but the details of his success are not even yet
generally known, and cannot be given here. By
October 6, 1914, he had sunk a German light cruiser
and a destroyer, both in the ‘North Sea,’ and it may
perhaps be guessed that he had, at any rate, thought of
penetrating into the Baltic. By January, 1915, he was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109">109</a></span>
a full Commander, and had received the D.S.O. On
the 29th of that month, he was not only in the Baltic,
but was sinking a destroyer there; on May 11, he bagged
a transport; and on June 5, he put to the credit of
E.&nbsp;9 another transport and another destroyer. Finally,
on July 2, he torpedoed the <i>Pommern</i>, a 13,000-ton
battle-ship of an older type, but armed with 11-inch
guns.</p>

<p>On July 29, he slipped again, in company with E.&nbsp;1
(Commander N.&nbsp;F. Laurence), and after some independent
hunting, the two boats both arrived at Reval. E.&nbsp;9
had attacked a cruiser and a submarine; and, on August
18, had had a covetous look at a squadron of battle-cruisers,
detailed for the German attack on the Gulf
of Riga. But as they were moving constantly in regular
formation, and at high speed over a large area, it was
not possible to deal satisfactorily with them. E.&nbsp;1, however,
had had better luck. On August 19, Commander
Laurence came to observation depth at 8.0 <span class="smcap smaller">A.M.</span>, and
under cover of a fog succeeded in stalking the same
squadron. They were manœuvring in line abreast,
and within ten minutes came across E.&nbsp;1’s bows, with
destroyers on both flanks. Commander Laurence had,
of course, only a single ship to aim at&mdash;the battle-cruiser
on the wing nearest to him, which was ascertained to
have been the <i>Moltke</i>, a 22,600-ton ship. At 8.20, he
fired his starboard torpedo, and at the same moment
dived to avoid a destroyer which was coming straight
for him. His luck was good, both ways. The torpedo
got home on the battle-cruiser, and the destroyer
missed E.&nbsp;1 by a few feet. The next day he reported
to the Russian Admiral at Reval.</p>

<p>These two boats were followed, on August 15, by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110">110</a></span>
E.&nbsp;8 and E.&nbsp;13. The fate of E.&nbsp;13 will not be forgotten
while there is any rightful indignation left in Europe.
On August 19, she got ashore on a neutral coast&mdash;the
Danish island of Saltholm&mdash;and there, with her crew
upon her, was deliberately shot to pieces by a German
war-ship, in defiance of all humanity and international
law. Her officers and men behaved with perfect
courage, but many of them were killed before they could
get away from the wreck of their boat.</p>

<p>Lieut.-Commander Goodhart’s account of the voyage
of E.&nbsp;8 is a plain and business-like document, but to
read it, with a map beside it, is to look far away into a
world of historic names and ever-present dangers. It
is easy enough to imagine the passage up the Skager-Rak,
always remembering that we must keep well out of
the central line of traffic, and that in the afternoon we
have to dive and pass under a whole fleet of steam trawlers.
At 7 <span class="smcap smaller">P.M.</span> it is possible to come to the surface again.
The Commander orders full speed, rounds the Skaw, and
enters the Kattegat. In the fading twilight, several
merchant-steamers are seen going north. The shore and
island lights twinkle out one by one&mdash;Hamnskar, Vinga,
Skaw, Trindelen, and Anholt. The night is short.
By 3.0 <span class="smcap smaller">A.M.</span> we must dive again, and lie quietly on shoal
ground, while the traffic goes over us. At 5.25 <span class="smcap smaller">A.M.</span> we
venture to the surface, but are put down quickly by
a steamer. At 7.0 we venture again, and do a scurry
of 1½ hours in a friendly mist. Then down again, and
crawl at 3 knots, till at 1.0 <span class="smcap smaller">P.M.</span> we are off the entrance
to the Sound.</p>

<p>Here Commander Goodhart has to make the choice
between going forward submerged, or waiting for darkness
and then attempting the channel on the surface.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111">111</a></span>
He is confident of being able to get to his position under
water, and decides accordingly to continue diving into
the Sound and wait for night inside. He proceeds at fifty
feet, and, by 3.6 <span class="smcap smaller">P.M.</span>, has verified his position, coming
up to twenty-one feet to do so. He goes down again to
fifty feet, and alters course to pass through the northern
narrows. At 4.10 <span class="smcap smaller">P.M.</span> he is east of Helsingör Light&mdash;‘By
thy wild and stormy steep, Elsinore!’ At 5.20,
after another observation, he goes to bottom in eleven
fathoms, feeling comfortably certain that he has not
been detected&mdash;so far&mdash;on his passage.</p>

<p>At 8.15 <span class="smcap smaller">P.M.</span> he rises to the surface. The Danish
shore is bright with many lights, the Swedish shore is
dark&mdash;all is exactly as it may have been a century and
more ago, when Nelson was there on his way to his
great battle. E.&nbsp;8 goes south-westward on the surface,
altering course to avoid being seen by two destroyers,
who are going north, along the Danish shore, at a great
pace. One of them suddenly turns south, but then
stops, as if in doubt. E.&nbsp;8 runs on into still more
dangerous waters; the lights of Copenhagen are blazing
brightly, and in Middle Ground Fort a searchlight is
working. Now and again it strikes the submarine.
Then come several fishing-boats, then two red lights
in a small craft going south, close over to the Danish
shore. She is on our starboard beam for some time,
but luckily not near enough to see us, and we head
boldly for Flint Channel.</p>

<p>Off Malmo, the shore lights are dazzling, and it is
extremely hard to fix a position. There are many fishing-boats
about, each carrying two bright lights. The
Commander orders the boat to be trimmed down, with
upper deck awash, and proceeds with one engine only,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112">112</a></span>
at seven knots. He steadies his course through Flint
Channel, passing at least twenty vessels towards the
western end of it, some carrying two and some three
white lights, and one making searchlight signals in
the air. The majority of the fishing-boats are no sooner
avoided by a change of course, than we run past a small
tramp showing a green light, and then three white ones.
She seems to have anchored; but two other vessels
have to be dodged, and then the ship which has been
signalling with searchlight. Immediately afterwards,
when just N.E. of the Lightship, with her three vertical
red lights, a small torpedo-boat or trawler sights us as
we creep by within 200 yards of her. Probably it is
the searchlight in Copenhagen which has shown us up.
Anyhow it is tally-ho at last!</p>

<p>She lights red and green flares, and alters course in
our direction. We dive, and strike bottom&mdash;‘very
strong bottom’&mdash;at nineteen feet on gauge, which immediately
decreases to fourteen feet. At fourteen feet,
then, we try to proceed on our course; but the ground
is fearfully uneven, and a succession of bumps brings
us to a dead stop. It is 11.40 <span class="smcap smaller">P.M.</span> After an anxious
quarter of an hour, the Commander rises to the surface.
The Drogden Lightship is on our starboard quarter. A
large destroyer or small cruiser is ahead of us, showing
lights&mdash;she is the one who had made searchlight signals.
She is only two hundred yards away, but the Commander
trims E.&nbsp;8 deep, and steals past on motors. Four minutes
this takes, and we then find a destroyer right ahead, and
only one hundred yards from us. There is nothing
for it but to dive. Down we go to twenty-three feet
on gauge; but at sixteen feet the boat strikes bottom
heavily on the starboard side, carrying away all blades<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113">113</a></span>
of the starboard propeller. We lie on the bottom and
listen to our pursuers overhead.</p>

<p>Life is now a matter of minutes and feet. At 12.15,
the boat goes down to eighteen feet, but is still bumping
badly. At 12.19, Commander Goodhart stops her and
comes silently to the surface. The destroyer is there,
close on our starboard beam. At 12.20, we dive again,
as slowly as we dare, and at seventeen feet we glide
away on our course, the depth of water mercifully
increasing as we go. For a long time we seem to be
escaping. Then, at 2.10 <span class="smcap smaller">A.M.</span>, we strike bottom again
at eighteen feet. An hour more, and we rise to the
surface, only to see the destroyer on our port beam.
Happily she is now a mile off, and does not see us. When
we come up again, at 7.15, there is nothing in sight.
At 8.53 we dive for a steamer, and at 10.40 for a destroyer.
E.&nbsp;8 is nearly out of breath now&mdash;her battery
is running very low.</p>

<p>Commander Goodhart decides to find a good depth,
go to the bottom, and lie there till darkness gives him
a chance of recharging. From 10.40 <span class="smcap smaller">A.M.</span> till 6.40 <span class="smcap smaller">P.M.</span>
we lie like a stone in twenty-three fathoms.</p>

<p>At 6.40 a Swedish steamer is still patrolling ahead.
At 8.25 <span class="smcap smaller">P.M.</span> a patrol of three vessels is close astern, and
very slowly moving east. The moon is too bright for
us and we dive again. At 9.30 we try once more, but
are put down by a shadowy destroyer to the southward.
At last, ten minutes before midnight, we find
a bit of sea where we and the boat can breathe in
peace.</p>

<p>But only for two hours; daylight comes early in
northern waters. It is now August 20. At 2.0 <span class="smcap smaller">A.M.</span> we
dive again, and lie in seventeen fathoms, spending<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114">114</a></span>
time and imagination upon the chart. We are well
out of the Sound now, and clear of the Swedish coast.
On our starboard beam lies the island of Rügen, where
we shall never make holiday again; further back, on
our quarter, is the channel that leads to Lübeck and
to Kiel, which we hope to visit yet. Right ahead is the
island of Bornholm, which we must pass unperceived,
and beyond it the whole expanse of the Baltic lies
open.</p>

<p>Commander Goodhart rises to the surface at 9.0 <span class="smcap smaller">A.M.</span>,
but dives again at noon. We are now not far west
of Rönne; and as he wishes to make sure of passing
Bornholm unobserved, he decides to remain on the
bottom till dark, then slip by and recharge his batteries,
for a long run north by daylight. By 7.0 <span class="smcap smaller">P.M.</span> we are
on our way, and eight hours later we are passing the
east coast of the great island of Gotland. At 9.2 <span class="smcap smaller">P.M.</span>
we dive for a light cruiser, which passes overhead
forward; at 10.0 we return to the surface and proceed
north-east, running past the entrance to the Gulf of
Riga and the island of Oesel. By 1.0 <span class="smcap smaller">A.M.</span> on August 22,
we have to dive for daylight; but by 3.0 we are up
again, and going on our course full speed. At 8.30
<span class="smcap smaller">A.M.</span> we sight Dagerört ahead and join E.&nbsp;9 (Commander
Max Horton). In company with her and with a Russian
destroyer, we pass into the entrance of the Gulf of
Finland; and by 9.0 <span class="smcap smaller">P.M.</span>, E.&nbsp;8 is secured in Reval
harbour. Within twenty-four hours, Commander
Goodhart has docked and overhauled her, replaced
her broken propeller, and reported her ready for
sea.</p>

<p>The career of E.&nbsp;8 in the Baltic was long and successful.
It began, so far as sinkings are concerned, with the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115">115</a></span>
destruction of the steamer <i>Margarette</i> of Königsberg by
gunfire, on October 5, 1915, and the most exciting day
in the record was October 23, when the <i>Prinz Adalbert</i>,
a cruiser of nearly 9,000 tons, fell to her first shot. E.&nbsp;8
was cruising off Libau when, at 8.50 <span class="smcap smaller">A.M.</span>, Commander
Goodhart observed smoke on the horizon, and altered
course to intercept the ship which was soon seen to
be an enemy. She had three funnels and two very
high masts, and was going west with two destroyers,
zigzagging&mdash;one on each bow.</p>

<p>Commander Goodhart ran on, at seven and a half
knots, till he got within 3,000 yards, when he eased to
five knots in order to lessen his wake. The wind was
slight, from S.S.E., and there was bright sunlight.
The conditions were ideal for an attack from the
southward. All tubes were made ready; the enemy
came on at an estimated speed of fifteen knots. At
9.28 the port destroyer passed ahead; four minutes
later, Commander Goodhart fired his bow tube at
the war-ship’s fore-bridge and began to look out for
results.</p>

<p>They came. After one minute he observed a very
vivid flash on the water-line at the point of aim. This
was immediately followed by a very heavy concussion,
and the entire ship was hidden instantly in a huge column
of thick grey smoke. Evidently the torpedo had
exploded the fore magazine. The sky was filled with
debris, and the smaller bits began falling in the water
near the submarine. There was no use in spending
time on the surface, and in one minute more, E.&nbsp;8 was
sliding down to fifty feet, where she stayed for eight
minutes, to give the rest of the ship ample time to come
down. At 9.42 Commander Goodhart rose to twenty<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116">116</a></span>
feet, and took a survey through his periscope. There
was no sign of the <i>Prinz Adalbert</i>. The two destroyers
had closed on to the scene of the explosion, but it was
not likely that they had been able to find any survivors,
for the destruction of the ship had been instantaneous
and complete. Commander Goodhart decided not to
attack them, because, for all he knew, they were ignorant
of his presence; if so, they might very probably imagine
the damage to have been done by a mine, and give him
future opportunities. The shot had been a long one,
about 1,300 yards, and this was in the circumstances
particularly fortunate; for at a shorter distance, such
as 500 or 600 yards, the submarine herself would have
felt a tremendous shock from the double explosion.</p>

<p>An hour later he saw four destroyers hovering about
the place of the wreck. He turned away, and they made
no attempt to follow. At dawn next day he reported
by wireless, and then proceeded to his base.</p>

<p>In the meantime E.&nbsp;19, Lieut.-Commander F.&nbsp;N.
Cromie, had arrived. She set to work in earnest upon
the German shipping engaged in the service of the naval
and military departments of the enemy, towards the
western end of the Baltic. Monday, October 11, was
her best day, and the beginning of a downright panic
in the Hamburg trade. ‘8.0 <span class="smcap smaller">A.M.</span>,’ says Lieut.-Commander
Cromie, ‘started to chase merchant shipping.’
He had good hunting. At 9.40 <span class="smcap smaller">A.M.</span> he stopped the
<i>Walter Leonhardt</i>, from Lulea to Hamburg, with iron
ore. The crew abandoned ship, and were picked up
by a Swedish steamer, considerately stopped for the
purpose. A gun-cotton charge then sent the empty
vessel to the bottom. By noon, E.&nbsp;19 was chasing the
<i>Germania</i> of Hamburg, signalling her to stop immediately.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117">117</a></span>
In spite of the signals and a warning gun-shot, she
continued to bolt, and soon ran ashore. Lieut.-Commander
Cromie went alongside cautiously to save her crew,
but found that they had already abandoned ship. He
tried to tow her off, but failed to move her&mdash;small
wonder, for her cargo consisted of nearly three million
kgs. of the finest concentrated iron ore, from Stockholm
to Stettin. He left her filling with water, and at 2.0
gave chase to the <i>Gutrune</i>. By 3.0 he had towed her
crew to the Swedish steamer, and started her for the
bottom with her 4,500,000 kgs. of iron ore, from Lulea
to Hamburg.</p>

<p>The game went forward merrily. At 4.25 he began
to chase two more large steamers going south. In twenty
minutes he had stopped one&mdash;the Swedish boat <i>Nyland</i>,
with ore for Rotterdam and papers all correct&mdash;told
her to proceed, and ten minutes later caught the <i>Direktor
Rippenhagen</i>, with magnetic ore from Stockholm to
Nadenheim. While she was sinking he stopped another
Swede bound for Newcastle, and gave her the <i>Direktor’s</i>
crew to take care of. An hour later, he proceeded to
chase a large steamer, the <i>Nicomedia</i>, who tried to make
off towards the Swedish coast. A shot across her bows
brought her to a more resigned frame of mind. She
proved to be a large and extremely well-fitted vessel,
carrying six to seven million kgs. of magnetic ore from
Lulea to Hamburg. The crew were sent ashore in boats,
and E.&nbsp;19 proceeded up the west of Gotland. Her cruise
was marked by one more incident&mdash;a significant one.
During the morning of October 12, Lieut.-Commander
Cromie stopped the <i>Nike</i>, and went alongside to examine
her. He found her to be in iron ore from Stockholm
to Stettin, under command of Captain Anderson,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118">118</a></span>
whose passport, from the Liverpool Police, proved him
to be a Swede. To a Hun, this would have made no
difference; but Lieut.-Commander Cromie had British
ideas on international law. He sent Lieutenant Mee
on board with a prize crew of two men, in the good old
style of our ancestors, and ordered them to take the
prize into Reval for further investigation. After what
we have already said about submarines and war policy,
the point needs no pressing. War against trading vessels
and non-combatants is possible within the rules, but
only in certain circumstances. Even where those circumstances
exist, there is no excuse for breaking the rules;
and where they do not exist, only a barbarian would
hack his way through the net of international law
and common humanity. Our Navy has in all circumstances
kept both these laws: the German submarines
have deliberately and cruelly broken both.</p>

<p>Lieut.-Commander Cromie continued to have the
good fortune he deserved. He ended the 1915 campaign
with another war-ship in his bag. Cruising in the
Western Baltic on the morning of November 7, he
sighted a light cruiser and two destroyers, but was disappointed
in his attempt to attack. Three hours later,
at 1.20, in a favourable mist, he had a second chance. A
light cruiser&mdash;perhaps the same&mdash;with one destroyer
in attendance, came on at fifteen knots, steaming south
and east. He dived at once, and at 1.45 fired his starboard
torpedo. The range was about 1,100 yards, and
the shot went home on the cruiser’s starboard side
forward. She immediately swung round in a large
circle and then stopped dead. She appeared to be on
fire and sinking. But Lieut.-Commander Cromie was
unwilling to leave her in uncertainty. He avoided the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119">119</a></span>
destroyer, passed under her stern, and manœuvred
for a second shot. This was fired at 1,200 yards, and
was aimed at the cruiser’s main-mast, just abaft of
which it actually struck. A double explosion followed.
Evidently the after magazine had blown up, and several
large smoking masses were shot out some 200 yards
in the direction of the submarine. The destroyer then
opened a heavy fire on the periscope with H.E. shell.
Down went E.&nbsp;19 for her life; but three minutes
later, she was up again to see what was happening.
The cruiser&mdash;she was the <i>Undine</i> of 2,650 tons&mdash;was
gone. The destroyer was picking up a few survivors,
and after a restless half-hour made off to the southward,
leaving on the scene only a ferry-boat flying the German
mercantile flag. Lieut.-Commander Cromie left also,
and arrived next day at Reval, where he reported the
attack and added that, under existing weather conditions,
it was only rendered possible by the sound judgment
and prompt action of Lieutenant G. Sharp, who
was officer of the watch at the time.</p>

<p>E.&nbsp;19 was not alone in her successful campaign
against the German iron-ore trade. A week after her
fine break recorded above, E.&nbsp;9 arrived on the scene;
and Commander Max Horton, in two successive days,
sank the <i>Soderham</i>, <i>Pernambuco</i>, <i>Johannes-Russ</i>, and
<i>Dall-Asfen</i>&mdash;four serious losses to the German gun
factories, and even more serious blows to the courage
of their carrying trade. The captain of the <i>Nike</i> told
Lieutenant Mee on his voyage to Reval, that after E.&nbsp;19’s
first raid no less than fifteen ships were held up at Lulea,
awaiting convoys; and after E.&nbsp;9’s success, the command
of the Baltic seemed to have passed for the time out
of German hands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120">120</a></span>
Such a state of things could not, of course, be continuously
maintained&mdash;the Baltic weather alone made
that impossible. E.&nbsp;1, E.&nbsp;8, and E.&nbsp;18 followed their
leaders, and all did good service during the autumn;
but their reports show how severe were the conditions
when the winter really set in. E.&nbsp;9 had already noted
very bad weather in November, and on the 25th ‘boat
became covered with a large quantity of ice.’ On
January 10, 1916, E.&nbsp;18, commanded by Lieut.-Commander
R.&nbsp;C. Halahan, reports ‘temperature very low:
sea very rough; great difficulty in keeping conning-tower
hatch clear of ice, as sea came over constantly
and froze at once.’ Two days later she proceeded to
Reval in company with a Russian ice-breaker. ‘The
ice was very thick in places, but no difficulty was
experienced in getting through.’ These hindrances
continued for months. As late as April 28, we find
E.&nbsp;18 accompanied through Moon Sound by an
ice-breaker ‘as there were occasional thick ice-fields.’
The next day some of these ice-fields came drifting
down upon the anchorage, and E.&nbsp;18 had to slip and
anchor off until night. Even so, she could not be sure
of escaping all danger; for the ice brought down
large masses of stone, and deposited them in the
channels.</p>

  <p class="captionr">[<i>See page</i> <a href="#Page_121">123</a>.
  </p></div>

<p>In spite of all difficulties and hardships, our submarines
continued their campaign indomitably, and
would no doubt at this hour still hold the mastery of
the Baltic trade, if the collapse of our Russian friends
had not deprived them of their bases and rendered
their operations useless. Early in April, 1917, it
became evident that Finland must fall into German
hands, and steps were taken to withdraw our naval<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121">121</a><a class="hidev" id="Page_122">122</a><br /><a class="hidev" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
force from the Baltic. But, for the boats themselves,
there could be no return from the scene of their voyages
and victories. They lay ice-bound in the harbour of
Helsingfors, and there they must end their unparalleled
story, for surrender to an enemy so unworthy was not
to be thought of.</p>

<p>As soon, then, as official news came of the landing
of German troops at Hango, these famous adventurers
were led to their last rendezvous. The Russian ice-breakers
freed them from the harbour ice. All the
Russian officers who had been attached to the British
flotilla, and who were then in Helsingfors, offered their
assistance for the funeral rites, and soon after midday
Lieut. Basil Downie, the officer in command of the submarine
depot, put to sea in E.&nbsp;1, followed by E.&nbsp;9, E.&nbsp;8,
and E.&nbsp;19. Each boat carried her death potion in the
form of torpedo warheads with a 20-lb. dry cotton charge
as primers. Three of these charges were allotted to
each&mdash;one forward, one aft, and one amidships; and
when the alarm-bell of the clock in each should ring,
contact would be made and the end would come. The
point decided on was reached at last. The bells rang,
and E.&nbsp;19, E.&nbsp;1, and E.&nbsp;9 sank to their own thunder.
E.&nbsp;8, by some failure of her clock, remained unhurt, and
since the ice-breaker could not stay out at sea longer,
she was left to die another day, with other comrades.
At 7.0 next morning, Lieut. Downie put to sea again
with C.&nbsp;26 and C.&nbsp;35 and the torpedo-barge, with the
few remaining stores. When the clocks rang this time,
E.&nbsp;8 sank, and C.&nbsp;26 with her. The barge and C.&nbsp;35 were
left to wait for C.&nbsp;27, the last of that victorious company.
On the following morning the barge was blown up,
and the two submarines were simply sunk in fifteen<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124">124</a></span>
fathoms. They went down uninjured, but within three
minutes two great explosions followed, and twelve-foot
columns of water shot up. ‘This, presumably,’ says
the report, ‘was the exploding of their batteries.’ Our
Viking ancestors would have said, perhaps, that it
was the bursting of their dragon hearts.</p>

<span class="subhead">BRITISH SUBMARINES IN THE DARDANELLES</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Our submarine campaign in the Sea of Marmora must
also have a separate chapter to itself, not only because
it is now a closed episode in the history of the War,
but because it was conducted under quite unique
conditions. The scene of operations was not merely
distant from the submarine base, it was divided from
it by an approach of unusual danger and difficulty.
The channel of the Dardanelles is narrow and winding,
with a strong tide perpetually racing down it, and
setting strongly into the several bays. It was moreover
protected, as will appear in the course of the
narrative, by forts with powerful guns and searchlights
and torpedo tubes, and by barrages of thick
wire and netting it was also patrolled constantly by
armed ships. Yet from the very first all these defences
were evaded or broken through with marvellous courage
and ingenuity; for nearly a year a succession of brilliant
commanders took their boats regularly up and down
the passage, and made the transport of Turkish troops
and munitions across the Marmora first hazardous,
and finally impracticable. Their losses were small;
but they passed the weeks of their incredibly long
patrols in continual danger, and snatched their successes
from the midst of a swarm of vigilant enemies. Two<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126">126</a></span>
battle-ships, a destroyer, and five gunboats fell to them,
besides over thirty steamers, many of which were
armed, nine transports, seven ammunition and store
ships, and no less than 188 sailing-ships and dhows
with supplies. The pages which follow contain notes
on the cruise of every British boat which attempted
the passage of the Straits; but they are far from
giving an account of all their amazing feats and
adventures.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Norman Holbrook had the honour of
being the first officer to take a British submarine up
the Dardanelles. He carefully prepared his boat&mdash;B.
11&mdash;for the business of jumping over and under
obstacles, by devices which have since been perfected
but were then experimental. The preliminary trials
turned out very satisfactorily, and on Sunday, December
13, 1914, as soon as the mainland searchlights
were extinguished at dawn, he trimmed and dived for
Seddul Bahr.</p>

<p>His main idea was to put certain Rickmers steamers
out of action, and perhaps the actual object of his
pursuit was the <i>Lily Rickmers</i>. He did not get her,
but he got something quite as attractive. It was
9.40 <span class="smcap smaller">A.M.</span>, or rather more than four hours from the
start, when at last he put his periscope above water,
and saw immediately on his starboard beam a large
two-funnelled vessel, painted grey and flying the
Turkish ensign. At 600 yards he fired his starboard
torpedo, put his helm hard a-starboard, and dipped
to avoid remonstrances. The explosion was duly
audible a few seconds later, and as B.&nbsp;11 came quietly
up of her own motion her commander took a glimpse
through the periscope. The grey ship (she was the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127">127</a></span>
battle-ship <i>Messudiyeh</i>) was still on his starboard beam,
and firing a number of guns. B.&nbsp;11 seemed bent on
dipping again, but Lieutenant Holbrook was still
more bent on seeing what he had done. He got her up
once more and sighted his enemy, on the port bow
this time. She was settling down by the stern and her
guns were no longer firing.</p>

<p>At this moment the man at the helm of B.&nbsp;11 reported
that the lenses of the compass had become
fogged, and the instrument was for the time unreadable.
Lieutenant Holbrook took a careful survey of his
surroundings, calculated that he was in Sari Siglar
Bay, and dived for the channel. The boat touched
bottom and for ten minutes went hop, skip and jump
along it, at full speed, until she shot off into deeper
water. Her commander then brought her up again,
took a sight of the European shore, steadied her by
it, and ran for home. By 2 <span class="smcap smaller">P.M.</span> he had cleared the
entrance. His feat was not only brilliant in itself; it
was an act of leadership, an invaluable reconnaissance.
In ten hours he had proved all the possibilities of the
situation&mdash;he had forced a strongly guarded channel,
surprised and sunk a battle-ship in broad daylight,
and returned safely, though he had gone up without
information and come down without a compass. The
V.C. was his manifest destiny.</p>

<p>In the following spring, after the guns of the Allied
fleets had failed to reduce the Turkish forts, the submarine
campaign was developed. It began with a
defeat&mdash;one of those defeats which turn to honour,
and maintain the invincibility of our Service. On
April 17, while attempting a difficult reconnaissance
of the Kephez minefield, E.&nbsp;15 ran ashore in the Dardanelles<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128">128</a></span>
within a few hundred yards of Fort No. 8.
Her crew were captured while trying to get her off,
and there was a danger of her falling into the enemy’s
hands in a serviceable condition. The only remedy
was to blow her up. She was no sort of a mark for
the battle-ships at long range; so during the night of
the 18th an attack was made by two picket boats,
manned by volunteer crews. The boat of H.M.S.
<i>Triumph</i> was commanded by Lieut.-Commander Eric
Robinson, who led the expedition, with Lieut. Arthur
Brooke Webb, R.N.R., and Midshipman John Woolley,
and that of H.M.S. <i>Majestic</i> by Lieut. Claud Godwin.
The fort gave them over two hundred rounds at
short range, mortally wounded one man and sank the
<i>Majestic’s</i> boat; but Lieut.-Commander Robinson succeeded
in torpedoing E.&nbsp;15 and rendering her useless.
He brought both crews off, and left even the Germans
in Constantinople admiring the pluck of his little
enterprise. One officer is reported by Mr. Lewis
Einstein, of the American Embassy there,<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> to have
said, ‘I take off my hat to the British Navy.’ He
was right&mdash;this midnight attack by a handful of boys
in boats has all the heroic romance of the old cutting-out
expeditions, and on Admiral de Robeck’s report
the leader of it was promoted to commander.</p>

  <div class="caption">‘The Fort gave them 200 rounds at short range.’</div></div>

<p>On April 25, A.E.&nbsp;2 went successfully up and entered
the Sea of Marmora; on the 29th, Lieut.-Commander
Edward Courtney Boyle followed in E.&nbsp;14. He started
at 1.40 <span class="smcap smaller">A.M.</span>, and the searchlight at Suan Dere was still
working when he arrived there at 4 o’clock. The fort
fired, and he dived, passing clean under the minefield.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129">129</a><a class="hidev" id="Page_130">130</a><br /><a class="hidev" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
He then passed Chanak on the surface with all the
forts firing at him. Further on there were a lot of small
ships patrolling, and a torpedo gunboat at which he
promptly took a shot. The torpedo got her on the
quarter and threw up a column of water as high as her
mast. But Lieut.-Commander Boyle could not stop
to see more&mdash;he became aware that the men in a small
steamboat were leaning over and trying to catch hold
of the top of his periscope. He dipped and left them;
then rounded Nagara Point and dived deep. Again
and again he came up and was driven down; destroyers
and gunboats were chasing and firing in all directions.
It was all he could do to charge his batteries at night.
After running continuously for over fifty hours, the
motors were so hot that he was obliged to stop. The
steadiness of all on board may be judged from the
record of the diving necessary to avoid destruction.
Out of the first sixty-four hours of the voyage, the
boat was kept under for forty-four hours and fifty
minutes.</p>

<p>On the afternoon of the 29th, he sighted three destroyers
convoying two troopships; fired and dipped&mdash;for
the destroyers were blazing at his periscope, and
he had only that one left&mdash;the other had stopped a
shot the day before. But even down below a thud
was audible, and the depth gauges flicked ten feet; half
an hour afterwards he saw through the periscope his
own particular transport making for the shore with
dense columns of yellow smoke pouring from her.
And that was her last appearance. A few hours later
he sighted A.E.&nbsp;2 and spoke her. She had sunk one
gunboat, but had had bad luck with her other torpedoes
and had only one left. Lieut.-Commander Boyle<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132">132</a></span>
arranged to meet her again next day; but next day
the gallant A.E.&nbsp;2 fell to a Turkish gunboat.</p>

<p>During these days the Sea of Marmora was glassy
calm, and the patrol ships were so troublesome that
Lieut.-Commander Boyle decided to sink one as a
deterrent. He picked off a small mine-laying boat, and
fired at a larger one twice without success, as the wake
of the torpedoes was too easily seen in the clear water.</p>

<p>The first four days of May he spent mainly in being
hunted. On the 5th, he got a shot at a destroyer
convoying a transport, and made a fine right-angle
hit at 600 yards, but the torpedo failed to explode.
This only whetted his appetite, and for three days he
chased ship after ship. One he followed inshore, but
troops on board opened fire on him and hit the boat
several times. At last, on the evening of May 10, after
being driven down by one destroyer, he sighted another
with two transports, and attacked at once. His
first torpedo missed the leading transport; his second
shot hit the second transport and a terrific explosion
followed. Debris and men were seen falling into the
water; then night came on rapidly, and he could not
mark the exact moment at which she sank.</p>

<p>Inside Constantinople they were already telling
each other yarns about E.&nbsp;14, and for her incredible
activity they even promoted her to the plural number.
‘One of the English submarines in the Marmora,’
Mr. Einstein wrote on May 11, ‘is said to have called
at Rodosto, flying the Turkish flag. The Kaimakam,
believing the officers to be German, gave them all the
petrol and provisions they required, and it was only after
leaving that they hoisted their true colours.’ The
story will not bear examination from our side; but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133">133</a></span>
no doubt it very usefully covered a deficiency in the
Kaimakam’s store account, whether caused by Germans
or by the Faithful themselves.</p>

<p>On May 13, Lieut.-Commander Boyle records a rifle
duel with a small steamer which he had chased ashore
near Panidos. On the 14th he remarks the enemy’s
growing shyness. ‘I think the Turkish torpedo-boats
must have been frightened of ramming us, as several
times, when I tried to remain on the surface at night,
they were so close when sighted that it must have been
possible to get us if they had so desired.’ The air
was so clear that in the daytime he was almost always
in sight from the shore, and signal fires and smoke
columns passed the alarm continually. He had no
torpedoes left and was not mounted with a gun, so
that he was now at the end of his tether. On the 17th
he was recalled by wireless, and after diving all night
ran for Gallipoli at full speed, pursued by a two-funnelled
gunboat, a torpedo-boat and a tug, who shepherded him
one on each side and one astern, ‘evidently expecting,’
he thought, ‘to get me caught in the nets.’ But he
adds,’did not notice any nets,’ and after passing another
two-funnelled gunboat, a large yacht, a battle-ship and
a number of tramps, the fire of the Chanak forts and
the minefield as before, he reached the entrance and
rose to the surface abeam of a French battle-ship of the
St. Louis class, who gave her fellow crusader a rousing
cheer. Commander Boyle reported that the success
of this fine and sustained effort was mainly due to
his officers, Lieutenant Edward Stanley and Acting-Lieutenant
Lawrence, R.N.R., both of whom received
the D.S.C. His own promotion to Commander was
underlined by the award of the V.C.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134">134</a></span>
Within twelve hours of E.&nbsp;14’s return, her successor,
E.&nbsp;11, was proceeding towards the Straits. The commanding
officer of this boat was Lieut.-Commander
M.&nbsp;E. Nasmith, who had already been mentioned in
despatches for rescuing five airmen while being attacked
by a Zeppelin in the Heligoland Bight during the action
on Christmas Day, 1914. He had been waiting his
turn at the Dardanelles with some impatience, and as
E.&nbsp;11’s port engine had been put completely out of
action by an accident on the voyage from Malta, he
had begged to be allowed to attempt the passage into
the Marmora under one engine. This was refused,
but his repairs were finished in time for him to take the
place of E.&nbsp;14.</p>

<p>He made the passage of the Straits successfully,
reconnoitred the Marmora and made a neat arrangement,
probably suggested by the adventures of E.&nbsp;14, for
saving the enemy the trouble of so much hunting. He
stopped a small coastal sailing vessel, sent Lieut. D’Oyly
Hughes to search her for contraband, and then trimmed
well down and made her fast alongside his conning-tower.
Being now quite invisible from the eastward,
he was able to proceed in that direction all day without
interruption. At night he released his stalking-horse
and returned westward.</p>

<div id="if_i_135" class="figcenter" style="width: 423px;">
  <img src="images/i_135.jpg" width="423" height="600" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">‘Made her fast alongside his conning-tower.’</div></div>

<p>Early on the 23rd, he observed a Turkish torpedo-boat
at anchor off Constantinople and sank her with
a torpedo; but as she sank she fired a 6-pounder gun,
the first shot of which damaged his foremost periscope.
He came up for repairs, and all hands took the chance
of a bathe. Five hours later he stopped a small steamer,
whose crew did a ‘panic abandon ship,’ capsizing all
boats but one. ‘An American gentleman then appeared<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135">135</a><a class="hidev" id="Page_136">136</a><br /><a class="hidev" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
on the upper deck, who informed us that his name was
Silas Q. Swing of the <cite>Chicago Sun</cite> and that he was
pleased to make our acquaintance.... He wasn’t sure
if there were any stores on board.’ Lieut. D’Oyly
Hughes looked into the matter and discovered a 6-inch
gun lashed across the top of the fore hatch, and other
gun-mountings in the hold, which was also crammed
with 6-inch and other ammunition marked Krupp. A
demolition charge sent ship and cargo to the bottom.</p>

<p>Lieut.-Commander Nasmith then chased and torpedoed
a heavily laden store-ship, and drove another
ashore, exchanging rifle fire with a party of horsemen
on the cliff above. Altogether the day was a lively one,
and the news, brought by Mr. Silas Q. Swing and his
friends, shook Constantinople up severely. Mr. Einstein
records that ‘the submarine came up at 20 minutes to
2 o’clock, about three hundred yards from where the
American guardship <i>Scorpion</i> lay moored, and was
immediately fired at by the shore batteries. It shot off
two torpedoes; the first missed a transport by about
fifty yards, the second struck the <i>Stamboul</i> fair, passing
under a barge moored alongside, which blew up. The
<i>Stamboul</i> had a gap of twenty feet on her water-line
but did not sink. She was promptly towed toward
Beshiktash to lie on the bottom in shallow water. The
submarine meanwhile, under a perfect hail of fire,
which passed uncomfortably close to the <i>Scorpion</i>, dived
and got away, steering up the Bosphorus. At Galata
there was a panic, everyone closing their shops; the
troops, who were already on two transports, were
promptly disembarked, but later re-embarked, and
still later landed once more. The total damage was
inconsiderable, but the moral effect was very real.’<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138">138</a></span>
On the following day he adds, ‘S.’ (Swing, no doubt&mdash;Silas
Q. Swing of the <cite>Chicago Sun</cite>) ‘came in with an
exciting tale. On his way to the Dardanelles the steamer,
which carried munitions and a 6-inch gun, had been
torpedoed by an English submarine, the E.&nbsp;11. They
allowed the crew to leave, and then sank the ship.
The English officer told him there were eleven submarines
in the Marmora, and these are holding up all
the ships going to the Dardanelles. They had sunk
three transports full of troops, out of four which had
been sunk, and various other vessels, but do not touch
those carrying wounded.’</p>

<p>So, between Lieut. D’Oyly Hughes and Mr. Silas
Q. Swing, the E.&nbsp;11 became eleven submarines, and
may go down the ages like the eleven thousand virgins of
Cologne. Her commander evidently hoped to create
a panic, and Mr. Einstein leaves us no doubt that the
plan succeeded to the full. On May 27 he writes again:
‘The Marmora is practically closed by English submarines.
Everyone asks where their depot is, and
how they are refurnished.’ May 28: ‘The submarines
in the Marmora have frightened the Turks, and all the
remaining transports, save one, lie tranquilly in the
Golden Horn. Otherwise I have never seen the port so
empty. One wonders where the submarines have their
base, and when and how it was prepared.’ He adds,
with some shrewdness: ‘Probably, if at all, in some
island of the Marmora, though the newer boats can
stay out a long time.’ E.&nbsp;11 was far from new, as
we have seen, but she was in hands that could make
her stand for quality as well as quantity.</p>

<p>Lieut.-Commander Nasmith brought his boat safely
back to Mudros on June 7. The last hour of his trip<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139">139</a></span>
was perhaps the most breathless, for while rushing
down by Kilid Bahr he found his trim quite abnormal,
and ‘observed a large mine preceding the periscope at
a distance of about twenty feet; which was apparently
hung up by its moorings to the port hydroplane.’ He
could not come to the surface, as the shore batteries
were waiting for him; but when outside Kum Kale, he
emptied his after-tanks, got his nose down, and went
full speed astern, dropping the mine neatly to the
bottom. This was good work, but not better than
the skill shown in navigating shoal water, or ‘the
resource displayed in the delicate operation of recovering
two torpedoes’ without the usual derrick to hoist
them in&mdash;an operation which may as well remain for
the present undescribed. Admiral de Robeck, in
recommending Lieut.-Commander Nasmith for the
V.C., speaks of his cruise as one ‘which will
surely find a place in the annals of the British Navy.’
It will&mdash;there can be no forgetting it. The very log
of E.&nbsp;11 deserves to be a classic. ‘Having dived
unobserved into Constantinople ...,’ says her Commander
soberly, and so, without a thought of it, adds
one to the historic despatches of the Service.</p>

<p>It was now E.&nbsp;14’s turn again. Commander Courtney
Boyle took her up on June 10, against a very
strong tide. At 9 o’clock next morning he stopped
a brigantine, whose crew abandoned ship ‘and then
all stood up and cursed us. It was too rough to go
alongside her, so Acting-Lieut. R.&nbsp;W. Lawrence, R.N.R.,
swam off to her, climbed aboard, and ... set fire to
her with the aid of her own matches and paraffin oil.’
On the 12th one of the Rickmers steamers was torpedoed.
Shortly afterwards there was a big explosion close to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140">140</a></span>
the submarine. ‘And I think,’ says her commander,
‘I must have caught the moorings of a mine with my
tail as I was turning, and exploded it.... The whole
boat was very badly shaken.’ But <i>Lily Rickmers</i> and
her sister were now both removed from the Turkish
service, for E.&nbsp;11 had evidently accounted for one of
them already. Mr. Einstein writes on June 13: ‘The
German Embassy approached us to cable Washington
to protest about the torpedoing without warning of
the two Rickmers steamers in the Marmora. One of
these was said to be filled with wounded, but their
note neglected to say that these had been discharged
from hospital and were on their way back to the Dardanelles.’
Only a German diplomatist could speak of
a ship carrying troops to the front as ‘filled with
wounded’; and Mr. Einstein adds, ‘One cannot but
be struck by the German inability to understand our
position over the <i>Lusitania</i>.’ The point is plain, and
goes deep. To the modern German mind all such considerations
are only a matter of words, useful for argumentative
purposes&mdash;that there should be any truth
of reality or feeling behind them is not imaginable.</p>

<p>The rest of this log is a record of destruction, but
destruction on thoroughly un-German methods. ‘June
20.&mdash;Boarded and sank 3 sailing dhows ... towed the
crew inshore and gave them some biscuit, beef, rum,
and water, as they were rather wet.’ ‘June 22.&mdash;Let
go passenger ship.’ 23.&mdash;‘Burnt two-master, and started
to tow crew in their boat, but had to dive. Stopped
two dhows: they were both empty and the crews looked
so miserable that I only sunk one and let the other go.’
24.&mdash;‘Blew up 2 large dhows: there was another one
about a mile off with no boat ... and thought I saw<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141">141</a></span>
two heads in the water. Turned round and found that
there were 2 men in the water at least half a mile from
their dhow. Picked them up: they were quite exhausted:
gave them food and drink, and put them on
board their ship. They had evidently seen the other
two dhows blown up and were frightened out of their
wits.’ There is nothing here to boast about&mdash;to us,
nothing surprising. But it brings to mind inevitably
the evidence upon which our enemies stand convicted.
We remember the long roll of men and women not only
set adrift in stormy seas, but shot and drowned in
their open boats without pity and without cause. We
admit the courage of the Hun, but we cannot admire
it. It is too near to animal ferocity, and stained with
a cruelty and callousness which are not even beast-like.</p>

<p>On June 21, Commander Boyle had rendezvoused
with E.&nbsp;12, Lieut.-Commander K.&nbsp;M. Bruce. ‘I got
her alongside, and we remained tied up for 3 hours.’
From this time onward the reliefs were arranged to
overlap, so that there were nearly always two boats
operating at the same time in the Marmora. Lieut.-Commander
Bruce came up on June 19, and found,
like others, that the chief difficulty of forcing the passage
was the heating of the main motors on so long and
strenuous a run.</p>

<p>The one great day of his nine days’ patrol was
June 25, when he brought off a hand-to-hand fight on
the surface with three enemy ships. At 10.45 in the
morning he sighted, in the Gulf of Mudania, a small
two-decked passenger steamer. ‘She looked,’ he says,
‘rather like a tram-car, and was towing two sailing-vessels.
In the distance was a sister of hers, towing
three more.’ He chased, and soon stopped the nearer<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142">142</a></span>
steamer. He could see, as he steamed round her, that
she was carrying a lot of stores. She had no boat, and
all the crew appeared to be on deck in lifebelts. He
could see no sign of guns, so he ran his bow up alongside
and sent his first-lieutenant, Tristram Fox, to board
her. But guns are not the only risk a submarine has
to take on such occasions. As the boarding party
stepped on board the steamer, a Turk heaved a bomb
over the side. It hit E.&nbsp;12 forward, but did not explode,
and no second one followed. The Turks, however, meant
fighting, and they opened fire with rifles and a small
gun, concealed somewhere aft. The situation was a
very anxious one, especially for Lieutenant Fox and
his boarding party; for they knew their own ship must
open fire in return, and it was difficult to take cover on
an enemy ship in action. Lieut.-Commander Bruce
was in a very tight corner, but he kept his head and
played his game without a mistake. He did not
hesitate to open fire with his 6-pounder, but he began
upon the enemy’s stern, where the gun was concealed,
and having dealt with that he turned to her other end
and put ten shots into her from fore to aft. His men
shot steadily, though under gun and rifle fire at a range
of only ten yards, and his coxswain, Charles Case,
who was with him in the conning-tower, passed up the
ammunition. Spare men, with rifles, kept the Turks’
heads down, and all seemed to be going well, when the
two sailing-ships in tow began a new and very plucky
move of their own. They came in to foul the submarine’s
propellers, and at the same time opened fire
with rifles, taking E.&nbsp;12 in flank. But by this time the
steamer was beaten, and the British rifles soon silenced
those in the sailing-ships. Then, as soon as Lieut.-<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143">143</a></span>Commander
Bruce had cleared the steamer, he sank
the three of them. The steamer had probably been
carrying ammunition as well as stores, for one of the
shots from the 6-pounder touched off something explosive
in her forward part. In fifteen minutes she was
at the bottom.</p>

<p>Lieut.-Commander Bruce was already thinking of
the other steamer with the three sailing-ships in tow.
She was diligently making for the shore, and he had
to open fire at her at 2000 yards. As he closed, the fire
was returned, not only from the ship but from a gun
on shore; but by this time he had hit the enemy aft,
and set her on fire forward. She beached herself,
and as the three sailing-ships had been slipped and were
also close under the shore, he had no choice but to
leave them. E.&nbsp;12’s injuries were miraculously slight&mdash;her
commander’s account of them is slighter still. ‘I
was very much hampered,’ he says, ‘in my movements
and took some minutes to get clear of the first steamer.
But only one man was hurt, by a splinter from the
steamer.’ This was quite in accordance with the old
English rule of the gun-decks: to hit and be missed
there’s nothing like closing. The story of this fine
little scrimmage ends with the special recommendation
by Lieut.-Commander Bruce of his first-lieutenant,
Tristram Fox, ‘who behaved exceedingly well under
very trying circumstances,’ and of his coxswain, Charles
Case, and three seamen&mdash;they all received the Distinguished
Service Medal. Of the commander himself
we shall hear again presently.</p>

<p>E.&nbsp;12 was recalled on June 28, leaving E.&nbsp;14 still
at work; and on the 30th her place was taken by
E.&nbsp;7, Lieut.-Commander Cochrane. On the way up, a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144">144</a></span>
torpedo from a tube on shore passed over him, and a
destroyer made two attempts to ram him, but he got
safely through and rendezvoused with E.&nbsp;14 on the
following evening. His misfortunes began next day,
when Lieut. Hallifax and an A.B. were badly burned
by an explosion in the hold of a captured steamer.
Then dysentery attacked the two remaining officers
and the telegraphist. Work became very arduous,
but work was done notwithstanding. Ship after ship
was sunk&mdash;five steamers and sixteen sailing-ships in
all. One of the steamers was ‘a Mahsousie ship, the
<i>Biga</i>,’ of about 3,000 tons. She was lying alongside
Mudania Pier, with sailing-vessels moored outside
the pier to protect her. But Lieut.-Commander
Cochrane saw daylight between this barrage and his
prey; he dived under the sailing-ships, and up went
the <i>Biga</i> with a very heavy explosion.</p>

<p>On July 17, he tried a new method of harassing the
Turkish army. He came up opposite Kara Burnu
and opened fire on the railway cutting west of it,
blocking the line&mdash;then dived, and went on to Derinjie
Burnu. The shipyard there was closed, but he observed
a heavy troop train steaming west, towards the block
he had so carefully established just before. He followed
up at full speed, and after twenty minutes of anxious hope
saw the train returning baffled. It eventually stopped
in a belt of trees at Yarandji Station; this made
spotting difficult, but E.&nbsp;7’s gunnery was good enough.
After twenty rounds the three ammunition cars of the
train were definitely blown up, and E.&nbsp;7 could move
back to Kara Burnu, where she shelled another train
and hit it several times.</p>

<p>All this was very disturbing to the Turks, and they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145">145</a></span>
tried every means to stop it at the source. They had
already a net in the channel, but it was quite ineffectual.
‘Now,’ says Mr. Einstein on July 15, ‘it turns out that
they have constructed a barrage of network to keep
out the submarines from the Dardanelles, and this
explains the removal of the buoys all along the Bosphorus.
They need these, and especially their chains,
to keep it in place.’ A week later, Lieut.-Commander
Cochrane saw these buoys on his way down. They
were in a long line, painted alternately red and black,
and stretching from a position a mile north of Maitos
village to a steamer moored in Nagara Liman. He
dived under them and went on his way; but later on,
below Kilid Bahr, the boat fouled a moorings forward
and was completely hung up, swinging round, head
to tide. By admirable management she was got clear
in half an hour, and then the same thing happened
again. ‘This time,’ says her commander coolly, ‘I
think the boat carried the obstruction with her for
some distance. I was expecting to see something foul
when we came to the surface, but everything was clear
then.’ What he and his men saw, during those two
half-hours, might also be described as ‘something
foul.’</p>

<p>The cruise of E.&nbsp;7 lasted for over three weeks, from
June 30 to July 24. On July 21, Commander Courtney
Boyle brought up E.&nbsp;14 once more. He, too, saw the
new net near Nagara, ‘a line of what looked like lighters
half-way across, and one small steamship in the vicinity.’
But he passed through the gate in it without touching
anything. This was lucky, as he had already scraped
against an obstruction off Kilid Bahr and cut his guard
wire nearly through. Once up, he got to work at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146">146</a></span>
once, and in a busy and adventurous three weeks he
sank one steamer, one supply ship, seven dhows and
thirteen sailing-vessels. In short, he made himself
master of the Marmora. The complete interruption
of the Turkish sea communications was proved by the
statements of prisoners. The captain of one ship
stated that Constantinople was full of wounded and
short of food, and that the troops now all went to
Rodosto by rail and then marched to Gallipoli&mdash;six
hours in the train and three days and nights marching,
instead of a short and simple voyage. All the Turkish
war-ships were above the second bridge in the Golden
Horn, and they never ventured out. There were no
steamers going to sea&mdash;all supplies to Gallipoli went in
sailing craft, towed by destroyers under cover of darkness.
It is clear that, to the Turkish imagination,
E.&nbsp;14 was like E.&nbsp;11&mdash;very much in the plural number.
On August 5, E.&nbsp;11 herself came on duty again, and the
two boats met at rendezvous at 2 <span class="smcap smaller">P.M.</span> next day. Half
an hour afterwards, Commanders Boyle and Nasmith
started on their first hunt in couples. Their quarry
was a gunboat of the Berki-Satvet class. The chase
was a lively one, and it was E.&nbsp;11, in the end, who
made the kill with a torpedo amidships. Then the two
boats came alongside again and their commanders
concerted a plan for shelling troops next day.</p>

<p>They took up their positions in the early morning
hours, and waited for the game to come past. Commander
Nasmith had been given the better stand of the
two; at 11.30 <span class="smcap smaller">A.M.</span> he observed troops going towards
Gallipoli, rose to the surface and fired. Several of
his shots dropped well among them and they scattered.
In less than an hour another column approached<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147">147</a></span>
along the same road. E.&nbsp;11 had retired, so to speak,
into her butt; she now stepped up again, raised her
gun, and made good shooting as before. ‘The column
took cover in open order.’</p>

<p>In the meantime Commander Boyle had been diving
up and down all the morning between Fort Victoria
and a point four miles up the coast to the east, about
a mile from shore. Three times he came to the surface,
but each time the troops turned out to be bullocks.
At 1.30 <span class="smcap smaller">P.M.</span> (when he came up for the fourth time) more
dust was coming down the road, and this time it was
the right kind of dust. As he opened fire he heard
E.&nbsp;11 banging away. She had left the place where he
had stationed her, to the N.E. of Dohan Aslan Bank,
and had come down to join him in his billet. The two
boats then conducted a joint action for the best part
of an hour. Commander Boyle got off forty rounds,
of which about six burst on the road among the troops,
and one in a large building. But the distance was
almost beyond his 6-pounder’s reach. He had to put
the full range on the sights, and then aim at the top
of the hill, so that his fire was less accurate than
that of Commander Nasmith with his 12-pounder. E.&nbsp;11
had strewed the road with a large number of dead
and wounded, when guns on shore came into action
and forced her to dive. She came up again an hour
and a half later and dispersed the troops afresh, but
once more had to dive for her life.</p>

<p>Next day, Commander Boyle ordered E.&nbsp;11 to
change billets with him, and both boats had luck, Commander
Boyle destroying a 5,000-ton supply steamer with
torpedo and gunfire, and Commander Nasmith bagging
a battle-ship. This last was the <i>Haireddin Barbarossa</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148">148</a></span>
She was passing about five miles N.E. of Gallipoli,
escorted by a destroyer. E.&nbsp;11 was skilfully brought
into position on her starboard beam, and the torpedo
got home amidships. The <i>Barbarossa</i> immediately
took a list to starboard, altered course towards the
shore, and opened a heavy fire on the submarine’s
periscope. But she was mortally hit. Within twenty
minutes a large flash burst from her fore part, and she
rolled over and sank. To lose their last battleship,
and so near home, was a severe blow for the Turks, and
they made every effort to conceal the depressing details.
Mr. Einstein, however, heard them and makes an
interesting entry. ‘The <i>Barbarossa</i> was sunk in the
Marmora and not in the Dardanelles, as officially announced.
She was convoying barges full of munitions
and also two transports, when she found herself surrounded
by six submarines.’ It is creditable to Commander
Nasmith that he did so well with only six of
his E.&nbsp;11 flotilla. Einstein continues: ‘The transports
were supposed to protect her, but the second torpedo
proved effective and she sank in seven minutes. One
of the transports and a gunboat were also sunk, the
other ran aground. Of crews of 700, only one-third
were saved.’ And on August 15 he records further
successes by Commander Nasmith&mdash;a large collier, the
<i>Ispahan</i>, sunk while unloading in the port of Haidar
Pasha, the submarine creeping up under the lee of
another boat; and two transports with supplies, the
<i>Chios</i> and the <i>Samsoun</i>, sunk in the Marmora.</p>

  <img src="images/i_149.jpg" width="422" height="600" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">‘She was mortally hit.’</div></div>

<p>Commander Boyle returned to his base on August 12,
with no further difficulty than a brush against a mine
and a rough-and-tumble encounter with an electric
wire obstruction, portions of which he carried away<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149">149</a><a class="hidev" id="Page_150">150</a><br /><a class="hidev" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
tangled round his periscope and propellers. His boat
had now done over 12,000 miles since leaving England
and had never been out of running order&mdash;a magnificent
performance, reported by her commander to be
primarily due to the excellence of his chief engine-room
artificer, James Hollier Hague, who was accordingly
promoted to warrant rank, as from the date of the
recommendation.</p>

<p>E.&nbsp;14 was succeeded on August 13 by E.&nbsp;2, Commander
David Stocks, who met Commander Nasmith
at 2 <span class="smcap smaller">P.M.</span> next day, and handed over a fresh supply
of ammunition for E.&nbsp;11. He also, no doubt, told him
the story of his voyage up. Off Nagara his boat had
fouled an obstruction, and through the conning-tower
scuttles he could see that a 3½-inch wire was wound with
a half turn round his gun, a smaller wire round the
conning-tower itself, and another round the wireless
standard aft. It took him ten minutes’ plunging and
backing to clear this and regain control; and during
those ten minutes, small explosions were heard continuously.
These were apparently from bombs thrown
by guard boats; but a series of loud explosions, a little
later, were probably from shells fired by a destroyer
which was following up, and was still overhead an
hour afterwards.</p>

<p>The two boats parted again, taking separate beats,
and spent a week in sinking steamers, boarding hospital
ships, and bombarding railway stations. When they
met again on the evening of August 21, Commander
Nasmith had a new kind of yarn to tell. His lieutenant,
D’Oyly Hughes, had volunteered to make an attack on
the Ismid Railway, and a whole day had been spent
behind Kalolimno Island in constructing a raft capable<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152">152</a></span>
of carrying one man and a demolition charge of gun-cotton.
Then the raft had been tested by a bathing
party, and the details of the plan most carefully laid
out.</p>

<p>The object was to destroy the viaduct if possible;
but, in any case, to blow up part of the line. The risk
involved not only the devoted adventurer himself,
but the boat as well, for she could not, so long as he had
still a chance of returning, quit the neighbourhood or
even conceal herself by submerging. The approach
was in itself an operation of the greatest delicacy.
Commander Nasmith took his boat slowly towards the
shore until her nose just grounded, only three yards
from the rocks. The cliffs on each side were high enough
to prevent the conning-tower being seen while in this
position. At 2.10 <span class="smcap smaller">A.M.</span> Lieut. D’Oyly Hughes dropped
into the water and swam off, pushing the raft with his
bale of gun-cotton, and his clothes and accoutrements,
towards a spot some sixty yards on the port bow of the
boat. His weapons were an automatic service revolver
and a sharpened bayonet. He also had an electric torch
and a whistle. At the point where he landed he found
the cliffs unscalable. So he relaunched his raft and
swam along to a better place. He reached the top
after a stiff climb, approached the railway line by a
careful prowl of half an hour, and went along it for five
or six hundred yards, hugging his heavy and cumbersome
charge. Voices then brought him up short.
He peered about and saw three men sitting by the side
of the line. After watching them for some time he
decided that they were not likely to move, and that
he must make a wide detour in order to inspect the
viaduct. He laid down his gun-cotton, and crept<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153">153</a></span>
inland, making good progress except for falling into a
small farmyard, where the fowls, but luckily not the
household, awoke and protested. At last he got within
three hundred yards of the viaduct. It was easy to see,
for there was a fire burning at the near end of it;
but there was also a stationary engine working, and
a number of workmen moving about. Evidently it
would be impossible to bring up and lay his charge
there.</p>

<p>He crept back therefore to his gun-cotton and
looked about for a convenient spot to blow up the
line. The best place seemed to be a low brick-work
support over a small hollow. It was only 150 yards
from the three men sitting by the line; but there was
no other spot where so much damage could be done,
and Lieut. D’Oyly Hughes was a volunteer, prepared
to take risks. He muffled the pistol for firing the fuse
as tightly as possible, with a piece of rag, and pulled
off. On so still a night it made a very loud noise.
The three Turks heard it and he saw them instantly
stand up. The next moment they were running down
the line, with Lieutenant D’Oyly Hughes going his
best in front of them. But a chase of this kind was
not what he wanted. His present object was to find a
quiet spot on the shore where he could take to the water
undisturbed, and he had no time to lose. He turned
on his pursuers and fired a couple of shots; the Turks
were not hit, but they remembered their own weapons
and began firing too, which was just the relief Lieut.
Hughes needed.</p>

<p>He had already decided against trying to climb
down by the way he had come up; but after a considerable
run eastward, he struck the shore more<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154">154</a></span>
conveniently about three-quarters of a mile from the
small bay in which E.&nbsp;11 was lying. As he plunged
into the water, he had the joy of hearing the sound of
a heavy explosion. His charge had hung fire for a
long time, but when it went it went well; fragments
were hurled between a quarter and half a mile, and
fell into the sea near the boat. There could be no
doubt that the line was effectively cut; and he could
now give his whole attention to saving an officer to
the Service.</p>

<p>This was the most desperate part of the affair.
After swimming some four hundred or five hundred yards
out to sea, he blew a long blast on his whistle; but the
boat was behind the cliffs in her little bay and failed to
hear him. Day was breaking rapidly; the time of
waiting for him must, he knew, be limited. With a
decision and coolness beyond comment he swam ashore
again and rested for a short time on the rocks&mdash;then
swam off once more, directly towards the boat. Before
he reached the bay, he had to discard in turn his pistol,
his bayonet, and his electric torch. At last he rounded
the point and his whistle was heard; but, at the same
moment, shouts came from the cliffs overhead, and
rifle fire opened on the boat.</p>

<p>She immediately backed, and came slowly astern
out of the bay, intent only upon picking up Lieut.
D’Oyly Hughes. But now came the most extraordinary
part of the whole adventure. In the early
morning mist the bow, the gun, and the conning-tower
of the submarine appeared to her distressed officer to be
three small rowing-boats advancing towards him, and
rowing-boats could only mean enemies. He turned,
swam ashore, and tried to hide himself under the cliffs.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155">155</a></span>
But he did not lose his head, and after climbing a few
feet he looked back and realised his mistake. He
shouted and plunged in again. Forty yards from the
rocks he was at last picked up, nearly done, for he had
run hard for his life and swum a mile in his clothes. But
he had done his work and E.&nbsp;11 was proud of him, as
appears from the concluding sentence in her log: ‘5.5
<span class="smcap smaller">A.M.</span> Dived out of rifle fire, and proceeded out of the
Gulf of Ismid.’</p>

<p>Commander Nasmith ended his cruise with a brilliant
week’s work. On August 22 he fought an action with
three armed tugs, a dhow, and a destroyer; succeeded
most adroitly in evading the destroyer, sinking the
dhow and one of the tugs by gunfire, and capturing a
number of prisoners, among whom was a German bank
manager with a quantity of money for Chanak Bank.
The prisoners willingly helped to discharge the cargo
of another captured ship&mdash;they were apparently much
surprised at being granted their lives. On the 25th,
two large transports were sunk with torpedoes; on
the 28th, E.&nbsp;11 and E.&nbsp;2, in company, bombarded
the magazine and railway station at Mudania. On
September 1, Commander Nasmith had an hour’s
deliberate shooting at the railway viaduct, scoring a
large number of hits; and on the 3rd he returned
without misadventure to his base.</p>

<p>Left to herself, E.&nbsp;2 now found that she also possessed
a heroic lieutenant. Under the date September 7
there stands the brief record: ‘Lieutenant Lyon swam
to and destroyed two dhows.’ The story, so well begun,
ends next day. At 2.15 <span class="smcap smaller">A.M.</span> this adventurer, like the
other, swam off with a raft and bag of gun-cotton. His
object, like the other’s, was to destroy a railway bridge.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156">156</a></span>
His friends watched him until, at seventy yards’ distance,
he faded into the dusk. From that moment onwards
no sound was ever heard from him. The night was
absolutely still, and noises on shore were distinctly
audible; but nothing like a signal ever came. It had
been agreed that if any trouble arose he should fire his
Webley pistol, and the submarine should then show
a red light and open fire on the station, which was
300 yards distant. For five hours she remained there
waiting. An explosion was heard, but nothing followed,
and broad daylight found Commander Stocks still
waiting with desperate loyalty. At 7.15 he dived out
to sea. An hour later he came to the surface and cruised
about the place, hoping that Lyon had managed somehow
to get into a boat or dhow. There were several
near the village, and he might be lying off in one. But
no boat drifted out, then or afterwards. Commander
Stocks came again at dawn next day&mdash;perhaps, as he
said, to bombard the railway station, perhaps for another
reason. Six days later he dived for home, breaking
right through the Nagara net, by a new and daring
method of his own.</p>

<p>It was now Lieut.-Commander Bruce’s turn again,
and he passed all records by patrolling the Marmora
successfully in E.&nbsp;12 for forty days. He had two other
boats in company during part of this time&mdash;E.&nbsp;20 and
H.&nbsp;1&mdash;and with the latter’s help he carried out a very
pretty ‘spread attack’ on a gunboat off Kalolimno, on
October 17. The intended manœuvre was for E.&nbsp;12 to
rise suddenly and drive the enemy by gunfire over H.&nbsp;1,
who dived at the first gun. The first drive failed, the
second was beautifully managed; but, in the bad light
of an approaching squall, H.&nbsp;1’s torpedo missed. In a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157">157</a></span>
third attempt the bird was reported hit by several
shells, but she escaped in the darkness. Lieut.-Commander
Bruce also did good shooting at a powder
factory near Constantinople; sank some shipping, and
made some remarkable experiments with a new method
of signalling. But his greatest experience was his
return journey.</p>

<p>He had passed through the net, he thought, but
suddenly observed that he was towing a portion of it
with him. The boat began to sink quickly, bows down;
the foremost hydroplane jammed. He immediately
forced her nose up, by blowing ballast tanks and driving
her at full speed. But, even in that position, she continued
to sink till she reached 245 feet. At that
depth the pressure was tremendous. The conning-tower
scuttles burst in, and the conning-tower filled with water.
The boat leaked badly, and the fore compartment had
to be closed off to prevent the water getting into the
battery, where it would have produced the fatal fumes
of chlorine gas.</p>

<p>For ten mortal minutes the commander wrestled
with his boat. At last, by putting three men on to
the hydroplane with hand-gear, he forced the planes
to work and the boat rose. He just managed to check
her at twelve feet and got her down to fifty, but even
at that depth six patrol vessels could be heard firing
at her&mdash;probably she was still towing something which
made a wake on the surface.</p>

<p>Blind, and almost unmanageable, E.&nbsp;12 continued to
plunge up and down, making very little way beyond
Nagara. The conning-tower and its compass were out
of action, but the commander conned his boat from the
main gyro compass, and when both diving gauges failed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158">158</a></span>
he used the gauge by the periscope. The climax was
reached when at eighty feet, just to the south of Kilid
Bahr, another obstruction was met and carried away.
But this was a stroke of luck, for when the commander,
by a real inspiration, put on full speed ahead and worked
his helm, the new entanglement slid along the side
of the boat and carried away with it the old one from
Nagara. The boat rose steeply by the bow and broke
surface. Shore batteries and patrols opened fire, and
a small shell cracked the conning-tower; others hit the
bridge, and two torpedoes narrowly missed her astern.
But she came safely through to Helles, and reached her
base after a cruise of over 2,000 miles.</p>

<p>H.&nbsp;1 also put nearly 2,000 miles to her credit, though
her cruise lasted only thirty days, as against E.&nbsp;12’s
forty. Lieutenant Wilfred Pirie, her commander, took
a hand in Lieut.-Commander Bruce’s signalling experiments
and co-operated in several of his military
enterprises, as we have already seen. He also worked
with E.&nbsp;20 and was the last to meet her. This was on
October 31, the day before he dived for home. After
that, nothing more was heard of her till December 5,
when Commander Nasmith, who was once more in the
Marmora with E.&nbsp;11, captured a Shirket steamer and
obtained much information from the captain, a French-speaking
Turk. According to his statement, E.&nbsp;20 had
been ambushed, and her officers and crew taken prisoners.
He also gave details of the German submarines based
at Constantinople&mdash;he thought there were ten of them,
including three large ones. Before accepting this,
we shall do well to refer again to Mr. Einstein, who
reports four small boats coming from Pola, of which
only three arrived; and one larger one, U.&nbsp;51, of which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159">159</a></span>
he tells an amusing story. U.&nbsp;51 had been at Constantinople,
but during August she went out and did
not return; it was rumoured that she had gone home,
or been sunk. Then the Turks were electrified by
news of the arrival of a new German super-submarine,
over two hundred feet long. All Constantinople
crowded to see her go out on August 30. ‘Departure
from Golden Horn of a new giant German submarine,
the U.&nbsp;54, over 200 feet long and with complete wireless
apparatus.’ Next day: ‘The U.&nbsp;54 turns out to be our
old friend U.&nbsp;51, with another number painted.’ On
September 2 Mr. Einstein adds sarcastically: ‘Report
that U.&nbsp;54 was badly damaged by a Turkish battery
at Silivri.... To mask this, they are spreading the
rumour that an English submarine ran aground, and
will doubtless bring in the German boat under a false
number as though she were a captured prey.’ And
two days later he was justified&mdash;‘U.&nbsp;54 lies damaged
in the Golden Horn from the fire of a Turkish battery.
The reported sinking of an English boat is a downright
lie.’</p>

<p>Commander Nasmith went down the Straits on
December 23, after a record cruise of forty-eight days.
In that time he sank no less than forty-six enemy ships,
including a destroyer, the <i>Var Hissar</i>, and ten steamers.
A fortnight before he left, E.&nbsp;2, Commander Stocks,
came up, and did good work in very bad weather,
until she was recalled on January 2, 1916. The season
was over, and she found, in passing down the Straits, that
the Turkish net had apparently been removed, either
by the enemy themselves, or perhaps by the wear and
tear of British submarines repeatedly charging it and
carrying it away piecemeal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160">160</a></span>
So ended our Eastern submarine campaign&mdash;a
campaign in which our boats successfully achieved
their military objects&mdash;in which, too, the skill of our
officers and men was only surpassed by their courage,
and by their chivalrous regard for the enemies whom
they defeated.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE U-BOAT BLOCKADE</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Nothing in the history of the past four years has more
clearly brought out the difference between the civilised
and the savage view of war, than the record of
the German U-boat campaign. All civilised men are
agreed, and have for centuries been agreed, about
war. In their view war may be unavoidable, in so
far as all order and security are ultimately dependent
on force; but it is a lamentable necessity, and when
unnecessary&mdash;that is, when undertaken for any object
whatever except defence against aggression or tyranny&mdash;it
is an abominable thing, a violation of human nature.
This view is not inconsistent with the plain truth that
the act of fighting is often pleasurable in itself, and
that, when fighting in a right spirit, men often reach
heights of nobility which they would never attain in
peaceful occupations.</p>

<p>The savage is in accord with this view on one point
only. He has the primitive joy of battle in him; but
he cares nothing for right or wrong, and his military
power is exerted either wantonly, or with the object
of plunder and domination. So long as he gratifies
his selfish instincts, he does not care what happens
to the rest of the human race, or to human nature.
Civilised men have for centuries laid down rules of war,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162">162</a></span>
that human industry and human society might suffer
only such damage as could not be avoided in the exercise
of armed force; and above all, that human nature
might not be corrupted by acts done or suffered in
brutal violation of it. These rules of chivalry were
not always kept, but by civilised nations they have
never been broken without shame and repentance.
Savage races sometimes have a rudimentary tradition
of the kind&mdash;the less savage they. But, in general,
they have a brute courage and a brute ferocity, without
mercy or law; and the worst of all are those who,
living in community with races of merciful and law-abiding
ideals, have themselves never been touched by
the spirit of chivalry, and have ended by making the
repudiation of it into a national religion of their own.</p>

<p>It has long been a recognised characteristic of the
British stock, all over the world, to regard a stout
opponent with generous admiration, even with a feeling
of fellowship; and to deal kindly with him when defeated.
But this chivalry of feeling and conduct, now
so widespread among us, is a spiritual inheritance and
derived, not from our Teutonic ancestors, but from our
conquest by French civilisation. It has never been
shared by the Germans, or shown in any of their wars.
Froissart remarked, five and a half centuries ago, on
the difference between the French and English knights,
who played their limited game of war with honour and
courtesy, and the Germans, who had neither of those
qualities. A century later, it is recorded of Bayard&mdash;‘Le
chevalier sans peur et sans reproche’&mdash;that whenever
he was serving in an army with a German contingent,
he was careful to stay in billets till they had
marched out, because of their habit of burning, when<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163">163</a></span>
they left, the houses where they had found hospitality.
In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries their barbarity
was unbounded; the Thirty Years’ War was the
lasting shame of Europe, and the Sack of Magdeburg
a final example of the triumph of the wild swine in
man. In the eighteenth century, Prussia produced a
grotesque anticipation of Zulu ideals, and called its
chief Frederick the Great. In the Napoleonic wars,
the cruelty of his German allies disgusted the Iron
Duke, who had commanded many ruffians and seen some
appalling days of horror. In our own time, we have
witnessed the brutal attacks on Denmark and Austria,
the treachery of the Ems telegram, and the development
of Bismarck’s blood-and-iron policy into the
complete Machiavellism of Wilhelm II and his confederates.
It is not a new character, the German; it
is an old one, long inherited. <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Nemo repente fit Tirpissimas.</i>
If anyone doubts this, or wishes to doubt
it, let him look through the criminal statistics of the
German Government for the ten years preceding the
War, and read the book of Professor Aschaffenburg,
the chief criminologist of Germany, published in 1913.
He will there find it stated and proved, that the most
violent and abominable forms of crime were then prevalent
in Germany, to a degree beyond all our experience&mdash;beyond
all imagination of what was possible in a human
community&mdash;and that the honest and patriotic writer
himself regarded this ever-rising tide of savagery,
among the younger generation, as ‘a serious menace
to the moral stability of Europe.’ It is against this
younger generation, with these old vices, that we have
had to defend ourselves; and now that we have beaten
them, now that the time has come when, if they had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164">164</a></span>
been clean fighters and fellow-men, every British hand
would have been ready for their grip, we can but hold
back with grave and temperate anger, and the recollection
that we have first to safeguard the new world
from those who have desolated and defiled the old.</p>

<p>Anger it must still be, however grave and temperate.
Look at the conduct of the War, and especially at the
conduct of the submarine war, as coolly and scientifically
as you can, you will not find it possible to separate
the purely military from the moral aspect. Technically,
the Germans were making trial of a new weapon which
it was difficult to use effectively under the old rules.
They quickly determined, not to improve or adapt the
weapon, but to abandon the rules. For this they were
rightly condemned by the only powerful neutral opinion
remaining in the world. But they not only broke the
law, they broke it in German fashion. Their lawlessness,
if skilfully carried out with the natural desire to
avoid unnecessary suffering, might have been reduced
to an almost technical breach, involving little or no
loss of life. But they chose instead to exhibit to the
world, present and to come, the spectacle of a whole
Service practising murder under deliberate orders;
and adding strokes of personal cruelty hitherto known
only among madmen or merciless barbarians. Finally&mdash;and
this concerns our future intercourse even more
nearly&mdash;the German people at home, a nation haughtily
claiming pre-eminence in all virtue, moral and intellectual,
accepted every order of their ruling caste,
and applauded every act of their hordes in the battle,
however abhorrent to sane human feeling. In all this,
we need make no accusations of our own; we have only
to set out the facts, and the words with which the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165">165</a></span>
German people and their teachers received them and
rejoiced in them.</p>

<p>It was towards the end of 1914 that the German
Admiralty conceived the idea of blockading the British
Isles by means of a submarine fleet. There were,
as we have already seen, great difficulties in the way.
For the pursuit and capture of commerce, a submarine
is not nearly so well fitted as an ordinary cruiser; is
not, in fact, well fitted at all. To hold up and examine
a ship on the surface is too dangerous a venture for a
frail boat with a very small crew; to put a prize crew
on board, and send the captured vessel into port, is
generally impossible. As an exception, and in case
of extreme necessity, it has always been recognised
that a prize may be sunk, if the crew and passengers
are safely provided for; but this proviso, too, is almost
impossible for a submarine to fulfil. Besides these
technical difficulties, there was also the danger of
offending neutral powers, especially if their ships were
to be sunk without evidence that they were carrying
contraband.</p>

<p>Under the advice of Grand Admiral von Tirpitz,
it was decided to defy all these risks and difficulties.
The question was asked by him, just before Christmas
1914, ‘What would America say, if Germany should
declare a submarine war against all enemy trading
vessels?’ and on February 4, 1915, a formal proclamation
followed from Berlin. This announced that the
waters round Great Britain and Ireland were held to
be a war-region, and that from February 18 ‘every
enemy merchant-vessel found in this region will be
destroyed, without its always being possible to warn
the crews or passengers of the dangers threatening.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166">166</a></span>
No civilised Power had ever before threatened to
murder non-combatants in this fashion; but there
was even worse to come&mdash;the seamen of nations not
at war at all were to take their chance of death with
the rest. ‘Neutral ships will also incur danger in the
war-region, where, in view of the misuse of neutral flags
ordered by the British Government, and incidents
inevitable in sea warfare, attacks intended for hostile
ships may affect neutral ships also.’ No ‘misuse of
neutral flags’ has ever been ordered by our Government.
The destruction of a merchant-vessel or liner without
warning or search, is not an incident ‘inevitable in
sea warfare’; it is an incident always avoided in any
sea warfare except that waged by barbarians.</p>

<p>A fortnight later the sinkings began; and on March 9
three ships were torpedoed, without warning, in one
day. In the case of one of these, the <i>Tangistan</i>, 37
men were killed or drowned out of the 38 on board.
On March 15 the stewardess and five men of the <i>Fingal</i>
were drowned. And on the 27th the crew of the <i>Aguila</i>
were fired upon while launching their boats; three
were killed and several more wounded. On the 28th,
the Elder-Dempster liner, the <i>Falaba</i>, from Liverpool
to South Africa, was stopped and torpedoed in cold
blood. As the crew and passengers sank, the Germans
looked on from the deck of the U-boat, laughing and
jeering at their struggling victims, of whom 111 perished.
‘The sinking of the <i>Falaba</i>,’ said the <cite>New York Times</cite>,
‘is perhaps the most shocking crime of the War.’</p>

<p>It did not long remain unsurpassed. In April, the
German Embassy at Washington publicly advertised
that vessels flying the flag of Great Britain or her
allies were liable to destruction, and that travellers<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167">167</a></span>
sailing in them would do so at their own risk. Intending
travellers smiled at this outrageous threat and went
on booking their passages to Europe. Even when
those about to sail in the huge liner <i>Lusitania</i> received
anonymous telegrams, warning them that the ship
would be sunk, no one believed that the Government
of a great Power could seriously intend such a crime.
Not a single berth was countermanded, and, on May 1,
the <i>Lusitania</i> sailed from New York, carrying, besides
her crew of 651, no less than 1,255 passengers.</p>

<p>On the morning of Friday, May 7, she made her landfall
on the Irish coast. The sea was dangerously calm;
but Captain Turner, wishing ‘to reach the bar at Liverpool
at a time when he could proceed up the river
without stopping to pick up a pilot,’ reduced speed
to 18 knots, holding on the ordinary course. At 2 <span class="smcap smaller">P.M.</span>
the <i>Lusitania</i> passed the Old Head of Kinsale; at
2.15 she was torpedoed without warning, and without
a submarine having been sighted by anyone on board.
Her main steam-pipe was cut, and her engines could
not be stopped; she listed heavily to starboard, and
while she was under way it was very difficult to launch
the boats. At 2.36 she went down, and of the 1,906
souls on board, 1,134 went down with her, only 772
being saved in the boats which got clear.</p>

<p>This was, for the German Government and the
German Navy, an unparalleled disgrace. The German
nation had still the chance of repudiating such a
crime. But they knew no reason for repudiating it; it
was congenial to their long-established character, and
differed only in concentrated villainy from the countless
murders and brutalities which had troubled the
criminologists before the War. The German people<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168">168</a></span>
adopted the crime as their own act, and celebrated it
with universal joy. ‘The news,’ said the well-known
<cite>Kölnische Zeitung</cite>, ‘will be received by the German
people with unanimous satisfaction, since it proves
to England and the whole world, that Germany is quite
in earnest in regard to her submarine warfare.’ The
<cite>Kölnische Volkszeitung</cite>, a prominent Roman Catholic
and patriotic paper, was even more delighted. ‘With
joyful pride we contemplate this latest deed of our
Navy, and it will not be the last.’ The two words
‘joyful’ and ‘pride’ are here the mark of true savagery.
Only savages could be joyful over the horrible death
of a thousand women, children, and non-combatants;
only savages could feel pride in the act, for it was in
no way a difficult or dangerous feat. But this half-witted
wickedness is clearly recognised in Germany as
the national ideal. In the midst of the general
exultation, when medals were being struck, holidays
given to school children, and subscriptions got up for
the ‘heroic’ crew of the U-boat, Pastor Baumgarten
preached on the ‘Sermon on the Mount,’ and gave his
estimate of the German character in these words:
‘Whoever cannot prevail upon himself to approve,
from the bottom of his heart, the sinking of the
<i>Lusitania</i>&mdash;whoever cannot conquer his sense of the
gigantic cruelty to countless perfectly innocent victims,
and give himself up to honest delight at this victorious
exploit of German defensive power&mdash;him we judge to
be no true German.’</p>

<p>‘It will not be the last.’ The threat was soon
made good. On August 9, of the same year, the White
Star liner <i>Arabic</i>, one day out from Liverpool, was 60
miles from the Irish coast when she sighted the ss.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169">169</a></span>
<i>Dunsley</i> in a sinking condition. She naturally steered
towards her; but as she approached, a submarine
suddenly appeared from behind the <i>Dunsley</i> and
torpedoed the <i>Arabic</i> without a moment’s warning.
Boats were got out, but the ship sank in eight minutes
and 30 lives were lost out of 424.</p>

<p>In both these cases the Germans, feeling that their
joy and pride were not exciting the sympathy of neutral
nations, afterwards tried to justify themselves by
asserting that our liners carried munitions of war.
This was obviously impossible in the case of the <i>Arabic</i>,
which was bound from England to America. With
regard to the <i>Lusitania</i>, an inquiry was held by Judge
Julius Meyer of the Federal District Court of New
York, who found that the <i>Lusitania</i> did not carry
explosives, and added: ‘The evidence presented has
disposed, without question and for all time, of any false
claims brought forward to justify this inexpressibly
cowardly attack on an unarmed passenger steamer.’</p>

<p>The year closed with the torpedoing, again without
warning, on December 30, of the P. and O. liner <i>Persia</i>,
from London to Bombay. She sank in five minutes,
and out of a total of 501 on board, 335 were lost with
her. Four of her boats were picked up after having
been thirty hours at sea.</p>

<p>The year 1916 was a not less proud one for Germany;
but it was distinctly less joyful. The American people
took a fundamentally different view of war, especially
of war at sea, and they began to express the difference
forcibly. The German Government, after months of
argument, was driven to make a show of withdrawing
from the most extreme position. They admitted, on
February 9, 1916, that their method was wrong where<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170">170</a></span>
it involved danger to neutrals, and they offered to pay
a money compensation for their American victims.
They also repeated the pledge they had already given,
and broken, that unarmed merchantmen should not
be sunk without warning, and unless the safety of the
passengers and crew could be assured; provided that
the vessels did not try to escape or resist. This again
is a purely savage line of thought; no civilised man
could seriously claim that he was justified in killing
unarmed non-combatants or neutrals by the mere fact
of their running away from him. As for the ‘safety
of passengers and crew,’ we shall see presently how
that was ‘assured.’</p>

<p>But it matters little how the pledge was worded;
it was never intended to be kept. Only six weeks after
it was given, it was cruelly broken once more. On
March 24, 1916, the French passenger steamer <i>Sussex</i>,
carrying 270 women and children, and 110 other
passengers, from Folkestone to Dieppe, was torpedoed
without warning as she was approaching the French
coast. Many were killed or severely injured by the
explosion, others were drowned in getting out the boats.
There were twenty-five Americans on board, and their
indignation was intense; for the ship was unarmed, and
carried no munitions or war stores of any kind. Nor,
as President Wilson pointed out, did she follow the
route of the transports or munition ships. She was
simply a well-known passenger steamer, and eighty of
her company on board were murdered in cold blood by
pirates.</p>

<p>The President went on to say that the German
Government ‘has failed to appreciate the seriousness
of the situation which has arisen, not only out of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171">171</a></span>
attack on the <i>Sussex</i> but out of the whole method
and character of submarine warfare as they appear
in consequence of the practice of indiscriminate destruction
of merchantmen, by commanders of German
submarines. The United States Government,’ he continued,
‘has adopted a very patient attitude, and at
every stage of this painful experience of tragedy upon
tragedy, has striven to be guided by well-considered
regard for the extraordinary circumstances of an unexampled
war.... To its pain, it has become clear
to it that the standpoint which it adopted from the
beginning is inevitably right&mdash;namely, that the employment
of submarines for the destruction of enemy
trade is of necessity completely irreconcilable with the
principles of humanity, with the long existing, undisputed
rights of neutrals, and with the sacred privileges
of non-combatants.’</p>

<p>This note touches the real point, and settles it;
until the submarine is as powerfully armed and
armoured, and manned with as large a crew as a
cruiser of the ordinary kind, it is not a ship which can
be used for the general purposes of blockade by any
civilised nation. And it may be added that, even if
the Germans had possessed submarines of a suitable
kind, they could not have brought their prizes into
port, because our Fleet and not theirs had the control
of the seas. As it was, they pretended once more to
submit, and gave nominal orders that merchant-vessels
‘shall not be sunk without warning and without saving
human lives, unless these vessels attempt to escape or
offer resistance.’</p>

<p>It was not intended that this third promise should
be kept; there were other ways of evading the issue.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172">172</a></span>
The <i>Rappahannock</i>, a ship which sailed with a crew
of 37, from Halifax, on October 17, 1916, was never
heard of again, except in the wireless message by which
the German Admiralty reported her destruction. The
plan of sinking without a trace was first officially
recommended by Count Luxburg, the German diplomatic
agent in the Argentine; but the German Professor
Flamm, of Charlottenburg, has also the honour of having
proposed it in the paper <cite>Die Woche</cite>. ‘The best would
be if destroyed neutral ships disappeared without
leaving a trace, and with everything on board, because
terror would very quickly keep seamen and travellers
away from the danger zones, and thus save a number
of lives.’ No doubt the <i>Rappahannock</i> was ‘spurlos
versenkt’; so was the <i>North Wales</i>, and so were many
others meant to be. The German method, in 1916,
was to torpedo the ship, and then shell the survivors
in their open boats. This was done in the cases of
the <i>Kildare</i> and the <i>Westminster</i>, both sunk in the
Mediterranean; but on neither occasion were the
pirates successful in killing the whole of the crew, and
their crime was therefore known and doubly execrated
by the whole civilised world. None the less, they
continued the hideous practice, and in the following
eight months fired upon the helpless survivors of
at least twelve ships, enumerated with authentic
details in a list published by the <cite>Times</cite> on August 20,
1917.</p>

<p>On the whole, the year 1916 was a difficult one for
the German people. The objections of America to the
practice of piracy were becoming uncomfortably urgent;
promises had to be made under compulsion, and the
‘joyful pride’ of the nation would have been much<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173">173</a></span>
diminished if it had not been reinforced by two successes
of a new kind. On March 17, 1916, the Russian hospital
ship <i>Portugal</i> was torpedoed off the Turkish coast in
the Black Sea. She carried no wounded, but had on
board a large crew and a staff of Red Cross nurses
and orderlies. It was a clear morning, the ship was
flying the Red Cross flag, and had a Red Cross conspicuously
painted on every funnel; but she was
deliberately destroyed, with 85 of those on board,
including 21 nurses and 24 other members of the Red
Cross staff. On November 21, a British hospital
ship, the <i>Britannic</i>, was sunk in the same way. She
was a huge vessel, and had on board 1,125 people, of
whom 25 were doctors, 76 nurses, and 399 medical
staff. The outrage was said by the Germans to be
justified by ‘the suspicion of the misuse of the hospital
ship for purposes of transport.’ This suspicion was
wholly unfounded, and the submarine commander
had taken no steps to enquire into the truth.</p>

<p>In 1917 and 1918, the ‘proudest’ and most ‘joyful’
period in the short history of the German Navy, there
was no longer any need for the humiliation of excuses.
On January 31, 1917, Germany proclaimed her intention
of sinking at sight every ship found in the waters
around the British Isles and the coast of France, or in
the Mediterranean Sea. It was at the same time
announced&mdash;quite falsely&mdash;that the German Government
had conclusive proof of the misuse of hospital
ships for the transport of munitions and troops, and
that therefore the traffic of hospital ships within certain
areas ‘would no longer be tolerated.’ President Wilson
dealt promptly with this infamous proclamation. On
February 3, he told Congress that he had severed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174">174</a></span>
diplomatic relations between America and Germany;
on April 6, he formally declared war.</p>

<p>The savages were now entirely free to take their
own way, and they took it. On the night of March 20,
1917, the hospital ship <i>Asturias</i>, steaming with all
navigating lights, and with all the proper Red Cross
signs brilliantly illuminated, was torpedoed and sunk
without warning. Of the medical staff on board, 14
were lost, including one nurse, and of the ship’s company
29, including one stewardess. On March 30, the
<i>Gloucester Castle</i> was torpedoed without warning, but
her wounded were all got off in safety. On April 17,
the <i>Donegal</i> and the <i>Lanfranc</i> were both sunk while
bringing wounded to British ports. In the <i>Donegal</i>,
29 wounded were lost, and 12 of the crew. The <i>Lanfranc</i>
carried, besides 234 British wounded and a medical
staff of 52, a batch of wounded German prisoners to
the number of 167, including officers. ‘The moment
the torpedo struck the <i>Lanfranc</i>,’ wrote a British officer
on board, ‘the Prussians made a mad rush for the
life-boats. One of their officers came up to a boat close
to which I was standing. I shouted to him to go back,
whereupon he stood and scowled, “You must save
<em>us</em>.” I told him to wait his turn. Other Prussians
showed their cowardice by dropping on their knees and
imploring pity. Some cried “Kamarad,” as they do
on the battle-field. I allowed none of them to pass
me.... In these moments, while wounded Tommies
lay in their cots unaided, the Prussian moral dropped
to zero. Our cowardly prisoners made another crazy
effort to get into a life-boat. They managed to crowd
into one&mdash;it toppled over. The Prussians were thrown
into the water, and they fought with each other in order<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175">175</a></span>
to reach another boat containing a number of gravely
wounded British soldiers.... The behaviour of our
own lads I shall never forget!’&mdash;but there is no need to
tell that part of the story; it is old, centuries old, and
is repeated unfailingly whenever a British ship goes
down.</p>

<p>In July 1917, a new type of ‘heroic deed’ was added
to the ‘proud and joyful’ list. At 8 <span class="smcap smaller">P.M.</span>, on July 31,
the <i>Belgian Prince</i> was torpedoed without warning;
the crew escaped in three boats. The submarine then
ordered the boats to come alongside, took the master
on board and sent him below. ‘Then,’ says Mr. Thomas
Bowman, chief engineer, ‘all the crew and officers were
ordered aboard, searched, and the life-belts taken
off most of the crew and thrown overboard. I may
add, during this time the Germans were very abusive
towards the crew. After this the German sailors got
into the two life-boats, threw the oars, bailers, and
gratings overboard, took out the provisions and
compasses, and then damaged the life-boats with an
axe. The small boat was left intact, and five German
sailors got into her and went towards the (sinking) ship.
When they boarded her, they signalled to the submarine
with a flash-lamp, and then the submarine cast the
damaged life-boats adrift and steamed away from the
ship for about two miles, after which he stopped. About
9 <span class="smcap smaller">P.M.</span> the submarine dived, and threw everybody in
the water without any means of saving themselves.’</p>

<p>Mr. Bowman swam till daylight, and was picked
up by a chance patrol-boat. The only other survivors
were a man named Silessi, and an American named
Snell, who had succeeded in hiding a life-belt under his
overcoat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176">176</a></span>
The intention here was, of course, that the <i>Belgian
Prince</i> should be ‘spurlos versenkt’; and in other
cases the same result was aimed at by ramming and
sinking the boats with the shipwrecked men in them.
The crews of the French steamers <i>Lyndiane</i> and <i>Zumaya</i>
were destroyed in this way in the summer of 1918;
and on June 27 the case of the <i>Llandovery Castle</i>
marked, perhaps, the highest pitch of German ‘pride.’
This hospital ship was torpedoed and sunk without
warning, though she was showing all her distinguishing
lights. After she had gone down, the pirate commander
took his U-boat on a smashing-up cruise among the
survivors; and by hurling it hither and thither, he
succeeded in ramming and sinking all the boats and
rafts except one, which escaped. The survivors in
this boat heard the sound of gunfire behind them for
some time; it can only be conjectured that the
murderers were finishing their work with shrapnel.
The number of those cruelly done to death in this
massacre was 244.</p>

<p>The deeds here enumerated form a small but
characteristic part of the German submarine record.
The total number of women, children, and non-combatants,
murdered in the course of the U-boat blockade,
is more than seventeen thousand. It has been a failure
as a blockade; nine million tons of British, and six
million of allied and neutral shipping have been sunk;
but the U-boats have never, for a day, held the control
of the sea. The policy was a device of savages, and
of a nation of savages. There is no escape from this
charge; for the policy was approved and deliberately
adopted, by the representatives of the whole German
people, with the exception only of the few despised<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177">177</a></span>
and detested Minority Socialists. In October 1918,
Herr Haase testified in the Reichstag: ‘Most of the
Parties are now trying to get away from the accentuated
submarine war ... in reality all the Parties, except
the Socialist Minority, share the guilt. The first resolution
in favour of submarine war was drafted by all the
leaders, including Herr Scheidemann and Herr Ebert.
The accentuation of submarine warfare was a natural
consequence. You Socialists are also guilty because,
to the very last, you gave the old <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">regime</i> the credits
for carrying on the War.’</p>

<p>The Germans do not yet realise the crime they
confess; they have corrupted one of the oldest and
noblest bonds in human life&mdash;the brotherhood of ‘them
that go down to the sea in ships, and have their business
in great waters.’ And this they have done because
they are, by nature, not seamen but savages.</p>

<span class="subhead">TRAWLERS, SMACKS, AND DRIFTERS</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Our Destroyer Service is perhaps as efficient, and as
dashing, as anything ever seen in the way of organised
human activity. It is long established, and its very
perfection seems almost to stand in the way of our
wonder at its achievement. The performance of our
trawlers and drifters, on the other hand, is the more
astonishing because it was an afterthought, the work of
a service called into being&mdash;suddenly created, as it were,
out of nothing&mdash;to meet the need of a grave moment
which no imagination could well have provided against.
When the moment came, everyone knew what might be
expected from our Navy. It had not occurred to anyone
that our fishermen might help to keep the sea against
an outbreak of piracy, not only with courage but with
marked success. Yet this they did; and of all the disappointments
which the War has brought our enemies
this must have been one of the most unexpected and
unpleasant.</p>

<p>In reading the accounts which follow, it will be
remarked that the work to which our trawlers and
drifters set themselves, with such admirable readiness
and courage, was not only new to them, but was continually
taking new and unforeseen forms, so that they
have been called upon to show quickness and adaptability,
as well as the capacity for training and discipline.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179">179</a></span>
The armament and methods of the submarine of 1915
were different from those of the later and more dangerous
boats of 1917. The trawlers, too, were much less
adequately armed and equipped. Our men had at
first to play a game in which there were no certain
rules, and no standard weapons. We can hardly over-praise
the officers of the R.N.R. who, in those critical
days, took command of the special-service trawlers and
fought them with the native skill of the Elizabethan
sea-dogs. Nor can we admire too heartily the ready
pluck and patriotism with which the skippers, mates,
deck-hands and boys of our fishing-fleets turned their
hands at a moment’s notice from nets to depth-charges
and twelve-pounders, and undertook the daily sweeping
of mines, in seas now doubly treacherous, and a hundred
times more deadly. There is a strange and almost
pathetic sound, even in the names of the little ships
themselves&mdash;names bearing none of the splendour of
history or the prestige of war, but the humble and
intimate memories of wives and children, or the jesting
pride of the homely seaport where they lived in the
time of peace.</p>

<p>The <i>Ina Williams</i> (now His Majesty’s Trawler, <i>Ina
Williams</i>) was steaming towards the Irish coast at
seven o’clock, one evening in early summer, when she
sighted a large submarine on her port beam, some two-and-a-half
miles away. The enemy had just come to the
surface; for there was no sign of him in that direction
a few moments before, and he had not yet got his
masts or ventilators up. The <i>Ina Williams</i> was armed,
fortunately, with a 12-pounder gun, and commanded
by Sub-Lieutenant C. Nettleingham, R.N.R., who had
already been commended for good conduct, and after<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180">180</a></span>
nine months’ hard work was not likely to lose a fighting
chance.</p>

<p>He headed straight for the U-boat. She might, of
course, submerge at any moment, leaving the pursuer
helpless. But Mr. Nettleingham calculated that she
would disdain so small an enemy, and remain upon the
surface, relying upon her trained gunners and keeping
her superiority of speed, with her torpedoes in case of
extreme necessity. He was right in the main. The
U-boat accepted battle by gunfire; but a torpedo which
missed the starboard quarter of the <i>Ina Williams</i> by
only 10 feet must have been fired at least as soon as the
trawler sighted her, and showed that the enemy was not
disposed to underrate even a British fishing-boat. Mr.
Nettleingham had saved his ship by the promptness
with which he turned towards the submarine, and he
now opened fire, keeping helm to avoid any further
torpedoes.</p>

<p>The fight was a triumph for English gunnery. The
<i>Ina Williams</i> had the good fortune to have fallen in
with a wildshot. All his five shells were misses&mdash;some
short, some on the trawler’s starboard side. The gunner
of the <i>Ina Williams</i> had probably had no experience of
firing at a moving target, almost level with the water.
The U-boat was going 10&ndash;12 knots, too, and that was
faster than he expected. The result was that his first
three shots failed to get her; they fell astern, but each
one distinctly nearer than the last. The pirate commander
did not like the look of things; he called in his
guns’ crews and prepared to submerge. Too late. The
British gunner’s fourth shot caught the U-boat on the
water-line, half-way between conning-tower and stern.
A fifth followed instantly, close abaft the conning-tower<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181">181</a></span>
itself. The wounded submarine was probably by this
time out of hand, for she continued to submerge. Just
before she disappeared, the sixth shell struck the conning-tower
full at the water-line, and the fight was over.
It had lasted fifteen minutes, and the <i>Ina Williams</i>
was still 3,400 yards away when the enemy sank. She
steamed straight on to the position of the U-boat, and
found that even after the ten minutes which it took her
to reach the spot, large bubbles of air were still rising,
and the sea was being more and more thickly covered
with a large lake of oil. The depth was fifty fathoms,
and out of that depth, while the <i>Ina Williams</i> steamed
round and round her buoy, she had the satisfaction of
seeing the dead brute’s life-blood welling up with bursts
of air-bubbles for nearly an hour, until the sea was
thick for five hundred yards, and tainted for a much
further distance. The smell of the stuff was peculiar,
and new to the trawler’s crew; they could not find the
right word to describe it. But they were eager to scent
it again, and as often as possible, for it meant good
work, good pay and a good report.</p>

<p>This was a thoroughly professional bit of service,
a single fight at long range; but it was no smarter
than the sharp double action fought by His Majesty’s
Armed Smacks <i>Boy Alfred</i> and <i>I’ll Try</i> against two
German submarines. The British boats were commanded
by Skipper Walter S. Wharton, R.N.R., and
Skipper Thomas Crisp, R.N.R., and were out in the
North Sea when they sighted a pair of U-boats coming
straight towards them on the surface. The first of these
came within 300 yards of <i>Boy Alfred</i> and stopped. Then
followed an extraordinary piece of work, only possible to
a German pirate. The U-boat signalled with a flag to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182">182</a></span>
<i>Boy Alfred</i> to come nearer, and at the same time opened
fire upon her with a machine-gun or rifles, hitting her in
many places, though by mere chance not a single casualty
resulted.</p>

<p>Skipper Wharton’s time had not yet come; he was
not for a duel at long range. He threw out his small
boat, and by this submissive behaviour encouraged the
U-boat to come nearer, which she did by submerging
and popping up again within a hundred yards. A
man then came out of the conning-tower and hailed <i>Boy
Alfred</i>, giving the order to abandon ship as he intended
to torpedo. But 100 yards was a very different affair
from 300. It was, in fact, a range Skipper Wharton
thought quite suitable. He gave the order ‘Open fire’
instead of ‘Abandon ship,’ and his gunner did not fail
him. The first round from the 12-pounder was just
short, and the second just over; but having straddled
his target, the good man put his third shot into the submarine’s
hull, just before the conning-tower, where it
burst on contact. The fourth shot was better still; it
pierced the conning-tower and burst inside. The U-boat
sank like a stone, and the usual wide-spreading patch of
oil marked her grave.</p>

<p>In the meantime the second enemy submarine had
gone to the east of <i>I’ll Try</i>, who was herself east of <i>Boy
Alfred</i>. He was a still more cautious pirate than his
companion, and remained submerged for some time,
cruising around <i>I’ll Try</i> with only a periscope showing.
Skipper Crisp, having a motor fitted to his smack, was
too handy for the German, and kept altering course so
as to bring the periscope ahead of him, whenever it was
visible. The enemy disappeared entirely no less than
six times, but at last summoned up courage to break<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183">183</a></span>
surface. The hesitation was fatal to him&mdash;he had
given the smack time to make every preparation. He
appeared suddenly at last, only 200 yards off, on <i>I’ll
Try’s</i> starboard bow; but his upper deck and big
conning-tower were no sooner clearly exposed than
Skipper Crisp put his helm hard over, brought the
enemy on to his broadside and let fly with his 13-pounder
gun. At this moment a torpedo passed under the
smack’s stern, missing only by ten feet, then coming to
the surface, and running along on the top past <i>Boy
Alfred</i>. It was the U-boat’s first and last effort. In
the same instant, <i>I’ll Try’s</i> shell&mdash;the only one fired&mdash;struck
the base of the conning-tower and exploded,
blowing pieces of the submarine into the water on all
sides.</p>

<p>The U-boat immediately took a list to starboard and
plunged bows first&mdash;she disappeared so rapidly that the
gunner had not even time for a second shot. <i>I’ll Try</i>
immediately hurried to the spot, and there saw large
bubbles of air coming up and a large and increasing
patch of oil. She marked the position with a Dan
buoy, and stood by for three-quarters of an hour with
<i>Boy Alfred</i>. Finally, as the enemy gave no sign of life,
the two smacks returned together to harbour.</p>

<p>For this excellent piece of work the two skippers were
suitably rewarded. Skipper Wharton, who had already
killed two U-boats and had received the D.S.C. and the
D.S.M. with a bar, was now given a second bar to his
D.S.C. Skipper Crisp already had the D.S.M., and now
received the D.S.C. But with regard to the gratuity
given to the whole crew of each boat for the destruction
of an enemy submarine, a distinction was made, <i>Boy
Alfred</i> being rewarded for a ‘certainty’ and <i>I’ll Try</i><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184">184</a></span>
for a ‘probable’ only. This is interesting as showing
the scrupulous caution with which our anti-submarine
returns have been made up. The Germans have tried
to persuade their public, at home and abroad, that
many of the U-boats claimed to have been destroyed by
us have, in fact, escaped, with more or less injury, and
made their way home to refit. The exact contrary is
the case. No one, with any power of judging the evidence,
could examine our official reports without coming to the
conclusion that the number of our successes has been
greatly underestimated in the published records. The
Admiralty have no doubt felt that, where so much is
at stake, it is better to run no risk at all of misrepresenting
the situation and its possibilities. If certainties
only are counted, and the campaign judged and conducted
accordingly, there will be no disillusionment
for us, and the long list of ‘probables’ will give us a
margin, uncertain in quantity, but absolutely sure to
be on the right side of the account. This policy has
entirely justified itself. In the long record of the anti-submarine
work of these four years, only one complete
disappointment has occurred, only one dead U-boat
has come to life again. On the other hand, the first
list of certainties published by the Admiralty&mdash;the list
of 150 pirate commanders put out of action&mdash;could not
be disputed, even by the authors of the German <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">communiqués</i>.
It is not an estimate, it is a statement,
beyond suspicion or dispute; but to ensure this result
restraint was necessary, and the restraint was often
regretted by the authorities as much as by the British
crews who felt themselves stinted of their full reward.
There was probably no member of the Board who did

<i>I’ll Try</i>; but her report, as here paraphrased, just fell
short of the full evidence required by the rules. She
killed her bird; but she could not <em>prove</em> that he was not
a runner.</p>

  <div class="caption">‘<i>I’ll Try’s</i> shell struck the base of the conning-tower.’</div></div>

<p>The same year, in the second week of August, two
other smacks distinguished themselves in action. The
first of these was the <i>G. and E.</i>, commanded by Lieutenant
C.&nbsp;E. Hammond, R.N. She was sailing at mid-day
in company with the smack <i>Leader</i>, and about a mile to
north of her, when she saw a submarine break surface
about three cables beyond to the south-east. Lieutenant
Hammond must have found it hard to play a waiting
game, but to go at once to the help of his consort would
have revealed that he was no unarmed fishing-boat.
The pirate, therefore, was able to board and blow up
<i>Leader</i> with a bomb, after ordering her crew into their
small boat. He then came on fearlessly, closing, as he
thought, another helpless victim. When within 200
yards he fired a rifle, and <i>G. and E.</i>’s crew encouraged
him by getting out a boat; but when he came to forty
yards and slewed round, parallel to the smack, Lieutenant
Hammond hoisted the White Ensign and opened fire.
The U-boat appeared to be paralysed with astonishment.
For a whole minute she lay motionless, and that
minute was just long enough for <i>G. and E.</i>’s gunner.
He got off five shots in a tremendous hurry. One was a
miss, and two hit the rail of the smack; but one of
these went on, and penetrated the enemy very usefully in
the lower part of the conning-tower. The other two
were clean hits in much the same spot. Down went the
enemy&mdash;not in the way a submarine would dive by
choice, but nose first, and with stern up at a very high
angle. The five men who had been on her deck and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187">187</a></span>
conning-tower, for the purpose of enjoying a little
shooting at British fishermen, got an entirely new view
of sport in these sixty seconds. One was killed with a
rifle-shot by a petty officer on the <i>G. and E.</i>, three disappeared
in the shell bursts, and the fifth was seen still
clinging to the conning-tower, as the U-boat carried
him down to death. The tide made all hope of rescue
vain&mdash;it was too strong even for a buoy to be put down
to mark the spot.</p>

<p>Four days later, on the same ground, the smack
<i>Inverlyon</i>, commanded by Skipper Phillips, with an R.&nbsp;N.
gunner, Ernest M. Jehan, sighted a submarine at 8.20
<span class="smcap smaller">P.M.</span>, steering right towards her in the twilight. When
the two boats were within less than thirty yards of each
other, the submarine was seen to be a U-boat flying the
German ensign, with an officer on deck hailing ‘Boat!’
Evidently he expected to be obeyed, for he stopped
dead and gave no sign of action. He had no gun
mounted, and appeared to be out of torpedoes.</p>

<p>Mr. Jehan might well have been taken by surprise
by this sudden meeting at close quarters in the dusk;
but he was not. In an instant the White Ensign was
hoisted, and he himself was firing his revolver at the
officer steering the enemy boat. This was his pre-arranged
signal for his mates to open fire, and it was
obeyed with deadly quickness and precision. The gun
was a mere pop-gun, a 3-pounder, but at the range it
was good enough. Of the first three rounds fired, the
first and third pierced the centre of the enemy’s conning-tower
and burst inside, while the second struck the
after part of the same structure and carried it away,
ensign and all. The officer fell overboard on the starboard
side.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188">188</a></span>
The submarine was now out of hand. The tide
brought her close round <i>Inverlyon’s</i> stern, within ten
yards, and the gun was instantly slewed on to her again.
This time, six rounds of extra-rapid fire were got off.
The first hit the conning-tower, the second and fourth
went over, the third, fifth and sixth hulled the U-boat
dead. She sank, with the same ominous nose-dive, her
stern standing up at an angle of 80°. The swirl was
violent, and in it three bodies were flung to the surface.
A shout was heard from one of them&mdash;a pirate, but a
man in agony. Skipper Phillips stripped, took a lifebuoy
in his arms and leaped overboard. He swam strongly,
but vainly, in that rush of wild water and oil, and at
last had to be dragged home on his own buoy. The
smack meantime was drifting over the dead submarine,
and brought up when her trawl got fast upon it.</p>

<p>The trawl was even more useful in another action,
where it actually brought on the fight at close quarters
and made victory possible. One day in February, H.M.
Trawler <i>Rosetta</i>, Skipper G.&nbsp;A. Novo, R.N.R., had gone
out to fish, but she had on deck a 6-pounder gun concealed
in an ingenious manner which need not be
described. She joined a small fleet of four smacks and
two steam trawlers some forty-five miles out, and fished
with them all night. Before dawn next morning a voice
was heard shouting out of the twilight. It came from
one of the steam trawlers: ‘Cut your gear away!
there’s a submarine three-quarters of a mile away;
he’s sunk a smack and I have the crew on board.’</p>

<p>‘All right, thank you!’ said Skipper Novo&mdash;to
get away from the pirate was precisely what he did not
wish to do. For some fifteen minutes he went on towing
his trawl, in hope of being attacked; but as nothing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189">189</a></span>
happened, he thought he was too far away from the
smacks, and began to haul up his trawl. He was
bringing his boat round before the wind, and had all
but the last twenty fathoms of the trawl in, when the
winch suddenly refused to heave any more, and the
warp ran out again about ten fathoms&mdash;a thing beyond
all experience. ‘Hullo!’ said the skipper, ‘there’s
something funny.’ He jumped off the bridge and asked
the mate what was the reason of the winch running
back. ‘I don’t know, skipper&mdash;the stop-valve is
opened out full.’ The skipper tried it himself; then
went to the engine-man and asked him if full steam was
on. ‘The steam’s all right.’ ‘Then reverse winch!’
said the skipper, and went to give a hand himself, as
was his custom in a difficulty. The hauling went on
this time, all but to the end.</p>

<p>Suddenly the mate gripped him by the arm&mdash;‘Skipper,
a submarine on board us!’&mdash;and there the enemy was,
a bare hundred yards off on the starboard quarter.
‘Hard a-starboard, and a tick ahead!’ shouted the
skipper, and rushed for the gun, with the crew following.
The gun was properly in charge of the mate, and he
got to it first; but the brief dialogue which followed
robbed him of his glory. ‘Right, skipper!’ he said,
meaning thereby ‘This is my job.’ But in the same
breath the skipper said: ‘All right, Jack. I got him!
You run on bridge and keep him astern.’ The <i>Rosetta’s</i>
discipline was good&mdash;the mate went like a man, and
the skipper laid the gun.</p>

<p>He was justified by his success. The enemy was very
quickly put out of action, being apparently unable to
cope with the whirlwind energy of Skipper Novo.
From the moment of breaking surface less than sixty<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190">190</a></span>
seconds had gone by, when the gun of the <i>Rosetta</i> began
speaking, and spoke nothing but hard words directly to
the point. The target was 250 feet long, and only 300
feet away. Every shot was a hit. The fourth caused
an explosion, and flames shot up four or five feet above
the submarine. Evidently she could no longer submerge,
and she attempted to make off upon the surface. But
Skipper Novo was right in his estimate of his own
chance&mdash;he had ‘got him.’ His fifth, sixth, seventh
and eighth shots were all direct hits on the receding
target, and at the eighth the enemy sank outright.</p>

<p><i>Rosetta</i> then spoke the smack <i>Noel</i>, which had been
close to her during the action, and now confirmed all
her observations. Skipper Novo had no doubt that the
U-boat had been the obstruction which was tangled in
his net. She had carried it all away, and to get clear
had been obliged to come to the surface without knowing
where she might find herself. As to her fate, there was
no reasonable doubt. But since neither debris nor
survivors were seen, the case, with rigid scrupulosity,
was refused a place among the certainties. The enemy
are no better off for that.</p>

<p>The story of two trawlers, <i>Lark II</i> and <i>Lysander III</i>,
will show how much difference luck may make in giving
or withholding the evidence necessary to prove a complete
success. These two boats were included in a
small division patrolling off the Cornish coast, and
hunted two submarines with apparent success, one in
March and one in April, but obtained the maximum
award on the first occasion only. The third ship of the
division was then the drifter <i>Speculation</i>, and the division
commander was Chief Skipper Donald McMillan,
R.N.R. He was in a certain position close inshore on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191">191</a></span>
March 10, listening with hydrophones for a U-boat
which was known to be on the prowl, when he sighted
a steamer about four miles away in the act of being
blown up. He made for her with all speed, but she
sank in four minutes; twenty-one of her crew of twenty-five
were found still floating in one small boat and a
raft. The Chief Skipper ‘interrogated’ the poor men,
and found that the ship was a Spanish steamer, the
<i>Christina</i>. Then he put them on board <i>Speculation</i>,
and ordered her to take them at once into St. Ives,
while <i>Lark</i> and <i>Lysander</i> carried out their hydrophone
work as before.</p>

<p>When <i>Speculation</i> had gone about 2½ miles on her
way, the Chief Skipper suddenly heard her fire a shot;
and the same moment she changed course and blew
her siren. <i>Lark</i> and <i>Lysander</i> raced to join the hunt
with their utmost speed. They found <i>Speculation</i>
cruising round, with depth-charges ready to drop. She
had already dropped two, besides firing her 3-pounder
into the wake of the enemy’s periscope, and had seen
not only oil, but some wreckage, and a large object
which rolled over and disappeared again. The Chief
Skipper ordered her to proceed on her course to St. Ives,
and then instructed <i>Lysander III</i> to stand by and drop
her depth-charges on the chance of stirring up the
wounded U-boat. Within five minutes he sighted the
wake of a submarine on his own port bow, only 100
yards distant but going fast. He made a bee line for the
wake, thinking it possible he might ram her, and when
just over the disturbance on the water he dropped his
first depth-charge. Then, as the submarine was still
making headway, he closed again and dropped his second
charge right over the wake. The enemy thereupon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192">192</a></span>
showed oil and ceased to make headway; so <i>Lark</i> and
<i>Lysander</i> alternately bombed his supposed resting-place
with no less than eight charges. After nearly an hour
of this, they stood by, listening on hydrophones and
watching the oil still rising. Then a destroyer arrived,
asked questions, heard the whole story and steamed
away without comment. Two hours later a motor-launch
came by, and was good enough to examine the
spot and contribute one more depth-charge. Two
hours more, and <i>Speculation</i> returned to spend the
night with her division&mdash;all listening keenly, but without
result. Finally, next morning, two sweepers, <i>John
Kidd</i> and <i>Castor II</i>, arrived and swept round about
the buoy which had been put down. The three boats
of the division stood by and watched anxiously; they
felt sure that the sweep fouled some object between
9 and 10 <span class="smcap smaller">A.M.</span>, but at 11.15 they received the order to
resume their patrol and went reluctantly away, foreboding
a verdict of ‘probably damaged.’</p>

<p>Twelve days later they had a joyful surprise. It
had been decided that as the depth of water, the
season, and other circumstances were all favourable,
it was worth while to send a diver to explore the spot.
Accordingly, on March 25, an officer diver went down
and succeeded in finding and examining the submarine.
She was lying on her port beam-ends in twenty-four
fathoms. Her conning-tower had been practically
blown off&mdash;evidently by a depth-charge which had
made a direct hit or something very near it. She
had also a large fracture in the hull, on the port
side amidships. This was, of course, conclusive, and
the division received the maximum award. They were
the more jubilant, because they had been quite certain<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193">193</a></span>
of their kill, and had picked up what they considered
first-rate evidence&mdash;not debris indeed, nor survivors,
but a lot of onions, which must have been brought there
by somebody. Also they had been told that their
‘obstruction’ was the wreck of an Italian ship, torpedoed
just about there only a few days before. It
was a consolation to have so annoying a suggestion
conclusively disproved.</p>

<p>The next action of <i>Lark II</i> and <i>Lysander III</i> fell
short of this final felicity. In April the division
passed under the command of Chief Skipper G. Birch,
R.N.R., and the third place in it was filled by the
drifter <i>Livelihood</i>. They were patrolling one evening
off Tintagel Head, when a periscope was sighted by
<i>Lark II</i>, about 500 yards away on the starboard quarter,
and going N.N.W. at the very slow speed of two
knots. It was noted as being very high, quite three
feet out of the water. The Chief Skipper came round
immediately in order to bring his guns to bear; but the
periscope had disappeared before he could accomplish
this. He then hoisted the necessary signals for warning
the rest of the division, steamed towards the last position
of the submarine, lay to, and listened with the hydrophone.
But at this moment the periscope reappeared;
it was now only one foot above the surface and not
more than twenty yards away, on the starboard beam.
This was, of course, too near for a torpedo, and <i>Lark II</i>
accordingly got her chance.</p>

<p>The first shot from her 12-pounder was an extraordinarily
happy one&mdash;it hit the periscope and scattered
it in splinters. The Chief Skipper lost not a moment&mdash;he
rang the telegraph for full speed, turned towards
the enemy, and as soon as he got way on the ship dropped<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194">194</a></span>
a depth-charge set for fifty feet. His miniature fleet
was perfectly in hand, and seconded him brilliantly.
Drifter <i>Livelihood</i> closed on his port quarter, and dropped
her depth-charge almost on the same spot; trawler
<i>Lysander III</i> followed with another. The three boats
continued to play the game in combination; the leader
dropping five depth-charges in all and the others three
each. All these exploded satisfactorily, and one of
the Chief Skipper’s produced a second heavy under-water
explosion, after which large quantities of dark
oil and air bubbles rose to the surface. The position
was then buoyed, and the division patrolled the area
all night, using hydrophones at intervals. Next morning
a wireless message was sent to Penzance, and another
trawler took the watch as relief. Sweeping operations
followed, but the bottom was reported rocky and foul,
and no satisfactory result was obtained. Diving was
not possible in such a place, and in the end the official
verdict was one of ‘Probably seriously damaged.’
For this the reward was only half of what would have
been given for a certainty; and, to the gallant trawlers
and drifters, that was probably the smallest part of
the disappointment. It is trying to end so exciting a
chase with a cry of ‘gone away,’ and especially so when
you are positive that the cry is a mistaken one. The
evidence for a kill was very strong&mdash;the enemy’s speed
was slow, his periscope was blinded, he was liberally
depth-charged at close quarters&mdash;there was a violent
double explosion to be accounted for, and a good uprush
of oil and bubbles. But the line is strictly drawn, and
this time the conclusive evidence was unprocurable.</p>

<p>Among the many cases of fine team-work by these
gallant little fishing-boats two more must be given here&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195">195</a></span>one
as an example of the deadly thoroughness and precision
with which our trawler and drifter divisions can
do their hunting, and the other to show how keenly
they will fight against an enemy armed with vastly
superior guns.</p>

<p>A division of four drifters&mdash;<i>Young Fred</i>, <i>Pilot Me</i>,
<i>Light</i>, and <i>Look Sharp</i>&mdash;under Lieutenant Thomas
Kippins, R.N.R., was patrolling one afternoon in April,
when at 5.25 <span class="smcap smaller">P.M.</span> Skipper Andrew Walker, R.N.R.,
sighted a periscope about 150 feet away on the starboard
quarter of his ship, <i>Pilot Me</i>. He immediately altered
course to starboard, and the submarine thereupon
submerged entirely. Skipper Walker passed over the
spot where she was last seen and dropped a depth-charge,
altered course rapidly and dropped another,
fired a red rocket to warn the division, dropped a third
and fourth depth-charge, and hoisted the signal asking
his commander to come north at full speed. He then
stopped his engines and listened on his hydrophone.
Hearing no sound, he made for <i>Young Fred</i>, who had
altered course and was now closing him. When the
two boats were only 300 yards apart, the submarine
came to the surface right between them. She rose at
an angle of 45°, bows up, and hung so for about two
minutes, during which <i>Pilot Me</i>, <i>Light</i>, and <i>Look Sharp</i>
all opened fire, and the two last claim to have hit her.
At any rate she went down again, stern first; but
Lieutenant Kippins, who was steaming straight for
her in hope of ramming, was not disposed to take
any chances. He took <i>Young Fred</i> exactly over her,
dropped two depth-charges and passed on. The explosion
which followed was a very heavy one; the fountain
of water which rose was mast high and completely<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196">196</a></span>
hid the drifter flagship from her companions, who
thought for a moment that she ‘had gone.’</p>

<p>The Chief Skipper was far from gone. The spray was
hardly off his deck, and the <i>Young Fred</i> was still rocking,
when he turned again and then again, dropping two
more depth-charges, and ordered <i>Pilot Me</i> to put down
a Dan buoy to mark the position. This was done,
but it was but marking a grave. H.M.S. <i>Express</i>, who
had received a wireless signal and hurried to the spot,
reports that she found the sea covered with oil, which
had extended in a long stream to the northward on the
ebb tide. Thick oil was still rising to the surface, and
there were streaks of dark brown colour, very noticeable,
and distinct from oil. Even when four miles to leeward,
whilst approaching, the new comers had been struck
by a very strong smell of petrol, which naturally gave
them hopeful expectations.</p>

<p>The expectations were fulfilled; in fact the evidence
brought on board the <i>Express</i> went almost beyond what
was acceptable to a British ship’s company who had not
just been fighting for their lives. The articles of wreckage
which it is possible to mention included a quantity
of brand-new woodwork, with bright brass fittings, a
large portion of a white wooden bunk, bits of furniture
and living-spaces, a shot-hole plug, two black-painted
gratings, a mattress and bedcover, two seamen’s caps,
with cap ribbons of the IV and V Untersee Boot Flotille,
and their owners’ names, a vest and two pairs of drawers;
also a red flag, a fit ensign for these lawless savages.
For their destruction, it is hardly necessary to say, the
full reward was given. Lieutenant Thomas Kippins
and Skipper Andrew Walker also received the D.S.C.
and two of their men the D.S.M.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197">197</a></span>
This was an execution rather than a fight; but our
fishermen can show their battles too, battles worthy of
the sea-dogs who kept the narrow seas against more
worthy enemies. In the Downs, and in the first twilight
of a November morning, three of His Majesty’s armed
drifters&mdash;<i>Present Help</i>, <i>Paramount</i> and <i>Majesty</i>&mdash;were
beginning their daily sweep, when Skipper Thomas
Lane, R.N.R., of the <i>Present Help</i>, which was spare ship
at the moment, sighted an object one mile distant to
the eastward. As day was breaking, she was quickly
marked for a pirate submarine&mdash;a huge one, with two
big guns mounted on deck, one a four-inch and one a
22-pounder. Nevertheless <i>Present Help</i>, <i>Paramount</i>
and <i>Majesty</i> opened fire at once with their 6-pounders,
not standing off, but closing their enemy, and continuing
to close her under heavy fire until they were hitting her
with their own light guns. Even our history can hardly
show a grander line of battle than those three tiny
ships bearing down upon their great antagonist; and
if U.&nbsp;48 did not fall to their fire, it is none the less true
that her surrender was due in the first place to their
determined onset.</p>

<p>It was <i>Paramount</i> who took and gave the first
knocks. Her searchlight was shot away, and she in
reply succeeded in putting one of the pirate’s guns out
of action. In the meantime&mdash;and none too soon&mdash;<i>Present
Help</i> had sent up the red rocket; it was seen
by two other armed drifters, <i>Acceptable</i> and <i>Feasible</i>,
who were less than two miles off, and by H.M.S.
<i>Gipsy</i>, who was four miles away. Skipper Lee, of the
<i>Acceptable</i>, immediately sang out ‘Action,’ and both
boats blazed away at 3,000 yards’ range, getting in at
least one hit on the enemy’s conning-tower. At the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198">198</a></span>
same moment came the sound of the <i>Gipsy’s</i> 12-pounder
as she rushed in at full speed.</p>

<p>The U-boat started with an enormous, and apparently
overwhelming, advantage of gun power. She ought to
have been a match, twice over, for all six of our little
ships. But she was on dangerous ground, and the
astounding resolution of the attack drove her off her
course. In ten minutes the drifters had actually pushed
her ashore on the Goodwin Sands&mdash;<i>Paramount</i> had
closed to thirty yards! Drake himself was hardly
nearer to the galleons. Then came <i>Gipsy</i>, equally
resolute. Her first two shots fell short; the third was
doubtful, but after that she got on, and the pirate’s
bigger remaining gun was no match for her 12-pounder.
After two hits with common pointed shell, she put in
eight out of nine lyddite, smashed the enemy’s last gun
and set him on fire forward. Thereupon the pirate
crew surrendered and jumped overboard.</p>

  <img src="images/i_199.jpg" width="600" height="332" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">‘The U-boat started with an enormous advantage of gun-power.’</div></div>

<p>It was now 7.20 and broad daylight. Lieutenant-Commander
Frederick Robinson, of the <i>Gipsy</i>, gave the
signal to cease fire, and the five drifters set to work to
save their drowning enemies. <i>Paramount</i>, who was
nearest, got thirteen, <i>Feasible</i> one, and <i>Acceptable</i>
two, of whom one was badly wounded. The <i>Gipsy’s</i>
whaler was got away, and her crew, under Lieutenant
Gilbertson, R.N.R., tried for an hour to make headway
against the sea, but could not go further than half-a-mile,
the tide and weather being heavily against them. They
brought back one dead body, and one prisoner in a
very exhausted condition; afterwards they went off
again and collected the prisoners from the other ships.
Then came the procession back to port&mdash;a quiet and
unobtrusive return, but as glorious as any that the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199">199</a><a class="hidev" id="Page_200">200</a></span>
Goodwins have ever seen. Full rewards followed, and
the due decorations for Skippers Thomas Lane, Edward
Kemp and Richard William Barker. But their greatest
honour was already their own&mdash;they had commanded, in
victorious action, His Majesty’s Armed Drifters, <i>Present
Help</i>, <i>Paramount</i> and <i>Majesty</i>.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE DESTROYERS</span></h2>
</div>

<p>The war record of our destroyers is unsurpassed. We
know that to the Grand Fleet we owe, as to a vast and
solid foundation, the unshaken fabric of our sea power,
and that in the day of battle it has always proved
itself incomparable. But we hardly, perhaps, realised
that in our destroyer force we have a second Grand
Fleet, equal to the other in spirit and seamanship,
greater in numbers, and counting its days of battle not
by twos or by twenties, but by the thousand. The work
of the destroyers has been unceasing. Setting apart
such service as their whirlwind attacks at Jutland, they
have done perhaps nine-tenths of the hard work of the
War, cruising and reconnoitring, convoying or rescuing
our ships, and hunting the pirate submarine. The
strain has been great, for they have been called upon
incessantly to do the work of twice their number;
they have answered the call, not with a dogged or defensive
courage, but with unfailing readiness and dash.
They have shown themselves the true successors of the
frigates and ships that were the pride of our proudest
days in the old time; their commanders are the right
heirs of the Brookes and Blackwoods, Parkers and
Pellews.</p>

<p>In considering the Anti-Submarine work of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202">202</a></span>
destroyers, it must be remembered that hunting is not,
generally speaking, their first object. They are out, not
for sport, but for ‘business as usual.’ They have a
large number of U-boats to their credit, but in most of
these cases the kill was incidental; it resulted from the
perfection of skill and smartness with which some professional
duty was being performed, at the moment
when the opportunity occurred. A few typical examples
will make this clear.</p>

<p>In August 1917, an upward sweep of the Norwegian
coast was being carried out by a light squadron, consisting
of three cruisers and six destroyers, the whole under
the orders of H.M.S. <i>Yarmouth</i>, Captain Thomas D.
Pratt, R.N., with Commander Geoffrey Corbett, R.N.,
as Senior Officer of Destroyers. The light cruisers were
in line abreast, visibility distance apart&mdash;anything
from five to ten miles&mdash;and each was screened by two
destroyers. The cruiser on the port wing was <i>Birkenhead</i>,
and the destroyer on her port bow was the
<i>Oracle</i>, which was therefore outside ship of the whole
squadron.</p>

<p>Just before dark, Lieutenant-Commander A. Grendon
Tippet, R.N., commanding <i>Oracle</i>, was informed that
very strong German wireless from two different sources
was being intercepted; and as one of the sources was
evidently near by, he decided to keep all hands closed
up to their quarters throughout the night. Nothing,
however, happened until broad daylight, when, at about
6 <span class="smcap smaller">A.M.</span>, Lieutenant Claude Butlin, officer of the watch,
sighted a vessel on the horizon. No one else on the
bridge could see it, but Mr. Butlin reported it, and his
captain, who knew his exceptional alertness and powers
of vision, ordered him to continue the look-out and report<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203">203</a></span>
again. Shortly afterwards the vessel was sighted by the
midshipman and the signalman of the watch, and was
pronounced to be a trawler.</p>

<p>But a few minutes after this Mr. Butlin saw a bow
and stern lift out of the water, well to left and right of
the vessel’s sail, and decided that she was a submarine.
He at once informed his commander, who ordered full
speed, course to be altered, and the proper signals to
be made. The sail then disappeared, and the submarine’s
conning-tower became clearly visible, at a distance of
something under seven miles.</p>

<p>At 6.7 the U-boat dived. The alarm had evidently
been given, and it was not likely that she would be
seen again on the surface; so at 6.10 Lieutenant-Commander
Tippet slowed down. But at 6.13 the submarine
unexpectedly broke surface less than three miles
away on the port bow; her conning-tower, or part
of it, could be seen moving fast through the water in
a cloud of spray. She submerged again in 10 seconds,
and <i>Oracle’s</i> course was at once altered to cut her off.
At 6.15 the enemy reappeared once more. Her bows
shot up out of the water at a steep angle, about half a
mile ahead. <i>Oracle’s</i> course was instantly altered one
point to port, telegraphs were put to full speed, and the
forecastle gun was ordered to fire common shell at the
conning-tower, which was then the only object visible.
The U-boat just then lifted her stern out of water,
showing a large vertical rudder on top of it, and the
gunner’s point of aim was shifted accordingly. Four
rounds were fired, but the target was a very difficult
one and was not hit.</p>

<p>At 6.15 events happened and orders were given in
very rapid succession. The U-boat was apparently not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204">204</a></span>
inclined to dive and risk paravanes or depth-charges.
Lieutenant-Commander Tippet no sooner grasped this
than he changed his tactics, and determined to ram.
It was, of course, desirable to strike the enemy at right
angles, and he endeavoured to con his ship so as to
secure this position. He gave the orders ‘Prepare
to ram’ and ‘Secure the depth-charge,’ and steadied
the ship on a point midway between the submarine’s
conning-tower (the top of which was just
showing) and the stern, which was about four feet
out of water. Then, at 27 knots, he drove <i>Oracle</i>
straight at her.</p>

<p>The crash came with lightning speed. At 6.17
<i>Oracle</i> cut into the submarine’s back, exactly in the
desired spot. It was, at the moment, inclined downwards
at an angle of 15°, with the top of the conning-tower
showing on the port side of the destroyer, and on
the starboard side about three feet of the freeboard at
the stern. The impact was heavy, and two officers on
<i>Oracle’s</i> deck, who had not ‘prepared to ram’ by taking
a completely prone position, were flung forward several
feet. At the same moment an explosion was heard
astern. It leaped into the Commander’s mind that this
was either a paravane detonating, or his own depth-charge,
which he had ordered to be secured, with the
object of avoiding any chance of a disaster from the
shock. It was, in fact, the depth-charge that exploded;
but in the right way, and not by shock. The order
had been misreported to the sub-lieutenant in charge
of the after-quarters&mdash;as it reached him, it was ‘Let
go the depth-charge.’ This he did personally and
with great accuracy, a few seconds before ramming,
so that when the explosion came, <i>Oracle’s</i> stern was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205">205</a></span>
well clear and no one was injured, except possibly the
enemy.</p>

<p><i>Oracle</i>, having cut through the U-boat, drifted on
for about 150 yards. The bows of the dying submarine
appeared momentarily above water, projecting some
3 feet at an angle of 45°. Then she sank, stern first, in
137 fathoms. For half a minute the surface showed a
big bubbling brown disturbance, and in the oil patch
appeared a quantity of debris, mainly large pieces of
unpainted cork, whose curved shape suggested that
they formed part of the lining of the hull. <i>Oracle</i>
herself was not undamaged, as may be imagined; her
bows were smashed from the water-line downwards,
and a considerable quantity of naval stores were
floating around her. She reported accordingly by
searchlight to the <i>Birkenhead</i>, who could just be discerned
at a distance of ten miles, and then returned
to her base to refit.</p>

<p>For this fine piece of work Lieutenant-Commander
Tippet received the D.S.O., and Acting-Lieutenant
Butlin the D.S.C. Nine of the crew were also decorated
or mentioned.</p>

<p>Here the destroyers were screening a line of war-ships,
who formed in themselves a fast and powerful
force. The convoying of slow and unarmed or lightly
armed ships is a very different business, but it is done
every day by our destroyers with amazing efficiency and
success. A good example is the case of the <i>Racoon</i>,
who destroyed an enemy submarine in the Mediterranean
while on escort duty.</p>

<p>In March 1917, the ss. <i>Osmanieh</i>, 4,440 tons gross,
owned by the Khedivial Mail Company, but chartered
by the Admiralty, was on passage from Malta to Madras<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206">206</a></span>
when, at about 5.40 <span class="smcap smaller">P.M.</span>, a hostile submarine was sighted.
The ship was commanded by Lieutenant Mason, R.N.R.,
and was flying the White Ensign; she was zigzagging,
and was escorted by a single destroyer, the <i>Racoon</i>,
Lieutenant-Commander Kenneth F. Sworder, R.N.
The weather was fine, the sea calm, and visibility good&mdash;about
eight or nine miles.</p>

<p>The submarine when sighted was about 1,500 yards
distant, and two or three points on the <i>Osmanieh’s</i>
starboard bow. Only six feet of her length was visible,
and she appeared to be drifting; puffs of blue-grey
vapour were coming from her, which seemed to hang
in the air and float away without disappearing. When
nearer&mdash;at 800 to 1,000 yards&mdash;she was seen to be moving,
for a ‘feather’ was visible as well as the vapour.</p>

<p>The <i>Osmanieh’s</i> head was put two points to starboard
to steer for the submarine; but as it changed
position rapidly, helm was put hard a-port, the whistle
was blown to draw the escort’s attention, and the alarm
gong was sounded. The ship then opened fire with her
two guns. The second round from the after gun appeared
to score a hit; but the U-boat was at that time almost
astern and shining brightly in the sun, so that it was
not possible to observe with certainty. <i>Racoon</i>, when
<i>Osmanieh</i> opened fire, was ahead of her, on the port
bow and going 16½ knots; but the moment the guns
were heard, Lieutenant-Commander Sworder increased
speed to 23 knots, put his helm hard a-port, and sighted
the U-boat. It had at first ‘the appearance of a calcium
light giving off intermittent puffs of smoke’; but when
the ship’s head was turned towards it, a periscope and
distinct feather were seen, as the submarine came out
of the trough of the swell.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207">207</a></span>
The manœuvre which followed was a very skilful
and effective one. <i>Racoon</i> came to meet <i>Osmanieh</i>,
who had now turned sixteen points to starboard and
was on the other side of the submarine and overhauling
her. <i>Osmanieh</i> continued firing till she saw her escort
only 400 yards from the target. She had intended to
try a depth-charge herself, and as soon as she passed
the U-boat she had stopped her port propeller for this
purpose, hoping to get the ship’s stern back into or
near the enemy’s course; but she now gave this up
and turned sharply away to port. As she did so, <i>Racoon</i>
crossed her stern at full speed, and immediately saw the
submarine on her own starboard side, the periscope
just showing about five yards off and moving almost
directly to meet her. Those on the destroyer’s deck
had a glimpse of about ten feet of a grey hull with green
and rust-coloured marks showing; then, as the ship
passed over this, she dropped her starboard depth-charge,
set to eighty feet, turned swiftly to port and dropped
her port depth-charge, four seconds after the first.</p>

<p>Eight or nine seconds passed while <i>Racoon</i> swung
round on her circle; then came the two explosions in
quick succession, throwing up columns of water with
bits of black debris in them. The ship continued to
turn to port, and completed nearly two circles round
the spot, ready to attack again. But nothing more was
needed, and she may even be said to have witnessed
the dying breath of her enemy. Some twenty or thirty
seconds after the explosions, the men stationed in the
after part of the destroyer, looking over the stern, saw a
fresh upheaval twenty-five yards or more to the right
of where the first columns of water had risen. This
‘seemed to come from below as if being pumped up,’<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208">208</a></span>
and it rose to about a foot above the level of the water,
making a ripple where the surface had been very calm.
On examination, it proved to be a fountain of dark
and very thick brown oil. <i>Racoon</i> and <i>Osmanieh</i>
proceeded accordingly, leaving that dark and evil-smelling
blot of oil upon the bright sea to give the ‘all
clear’ to every passing ship.</p>

<p>Lieutenant-Commander Sworder received the D.S.O.
on this occasion, Lieutenant Berthon the D.S.C., and
three men the D.S.M.</p>

<p>It may be noted that in neither of these two cases did
the submarine attempt to escape by submerging entirely.
We can only guess at the reasons. Possibly the U-boat
which attacked <i>Osmanieh</i> thought she could win in a
single fight against a lightly armed ship, and was too
much preoccupied to see <i>Racoon’s</i> deadly onset until
it was too late to avoid it. But <i>Oracle’s</i> enemy had
certainty sufficient time to make her choice between the
ram and the depth-charge; and the fact that she decided
to keep near the surface is very suggestive. The combination
of the hydrophone and the depth-charge is a
terrible one to contend against. The submarine which
dives is under the double disability of being both blind
and audible. The depths of the sea are no safe hiding-place
for the assassin flying from justice; given a
sufficient patrol, his undersea refuge is gone.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the surface is hardly better, when
it is covered by an adequate number of destroyers,
manned by British seamen. The vigilance and decision
with which they mark and seize their opportunities are
well shown in the following case of the destruction of a
submarine in the dead of night.</p>

<p>Early in May 1917, three destroyers&mdash;<i>Miranda</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209">209</a></span>
<i>Lance</i> and <i>Milne</i>&mdash;were patrolling a well-known area,
where the enemy has once or twice attempted runaway
raids under cover of night. This was a likely enough
evening for him; for there was a moon only two days
past the full, and from time to time a drift of rainy cloud
across it. To-night, however, it was not with a flurry
of destroyers that he came, but with a creep of mine-layers&mdash;U.C.-boats
stealing in across the black and silver
water to lay their deadly eggs close to our barrage.</p>

<div id="if_i_211" class="figcenter" style="width: 419px;">
  <img src="images/i_211.jpg" width="419" height="600" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">‘U.C.-boats stealing in across the black and silver water.’</div></div>

<p>One of these was sighted by <i>Lance</i>, and killed by her,
in the belief of the look-out who were watching from
<i>Miranda</i>; but with that one we have nothing to do.
Another, U.C.&nbsp;26, is our concern, and about her we know
all that there is to know. She was travelling on the
surface about an hour after midnight&mdash;she had finished
laying her mines, and was heading about east&mdash;when
she suddenly sighted the dark form of an English
destroyer within a dangerously short distance of her.
At the same moment <i>Milne</i>&mdash;or rather the perfectly
trained team of men who were the eyes, the brain and
the heart of her&mdash;sighted their enemy. Lieutenant
Leonard Pearson and leading signalman William
Smith were the first, and their Commanding Officer,
Commander V.&nbsp;L.&nbsp;A. Campbell, reports that it was only
by reason of their exceptional vigilance that the attack
could be so timed as to achieve success. The submarine,
without losing a moment, dived&mdash;or rather attempted
to dive. But Commander Campbell was as quick as
his look-out, and his helmsman and engine-room watch
were as quick as their Commander. A trace of hesitation&mdash;an
order not caught, or misheard, or obeyed with
less than absolute precision&mdash;and U.C.&nbsp;26 would have
been in hiding. But she was hardly sighted and reported<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210">210</a></span>
before the fatal orders were sharply and clearly given.
Commander Campbell’s voice had hardly reached his
chief petty officer, Frederick Robinson, before the
helm had brought the ship upon her altered course; and
even as she turned Ernest Pike and John Reason down
below were repeating the call for full speed to the chief
engineer.</p>

<p>No greater tension can be imagined than that on
board the two boats during the few interminable seconds
of the onset. This submarine, at any rate, was not unconscious
of her danger. She was wide awake, with
a possible margin of one second between safety and
destruction. Her deck was already awash; only her
conning-tower was still clear above the surface when
the destroyer struck her just before it, and cut clean
through her hull. She took in water in an overwhelming
rush, and went straight to the bottom. Scarcely had
she reached it when the pressure of air, increasing as
the water rose inside her, seemed to give her unhappy
crew a last forlorn chance of escape. The Captain was
in the engine-room, so that the exit by the conning-tower
hatch, which would have been his prerogative,
was left to the second officer, who succeeded in reaching
the surface. Of the remaining 26 members of the crew,
7 got the engine-room hatch open, and 5 at least escaped
by it; but only one of the whole number was picked
up alive. He was a Dane from Schleswig-Holstein, and
had been pressed for submarine service.</p>

<p>For this smart piece of work, in every way characteristic
of our Destroyer Service, Commander V.&nbsp;L.&nbsp;A.
Campbell received a bar to his D.S.O. Lieutenant L.
Pearson was awarded the D.S.C., and the other four
men already mentioned received the D.S.M.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211">211</a><a class="hidev" id="Page_212">212</a></span>
The next case is also typical, being a patrol action;
but it differs from the last in that the success was due
to combined work by three destroyers, and not only
by a single crew. There are also one or two exceptional
circumstances which distinguish it from other actions
of a similar kind&mdash;the presence of the Rear-Admiral
commanding the local force, and the additional evidence
which eventually settled the classification of the result.</p>

<p>It was on the morning of a day in March 1918 that
a light-cruiser squadron was cruising in the North
Sea; and at 9.25 <span class="smcap smaller">A.M.</span> three destroyers&mdash;<i>Thruster</i>,
Commander A.&nbsp;D. Gibbs; <i>Retriever</i>, Commander E.&nbsp;W.
Taylor; and <i>Sturgeon</i>, Lieutenant-Commander Henry
Coombs&mdash;were ordered to take up a screening position
ahead of the force. As they were in the act of moving
to their stations an object was sighted, two points on
<i>Sturgeon’s</i> port bow, and about one mile distant. A
moment afterwards it was recognised as the conning-tower
of a submarine. In order to understand what
followed, it is necessary to have the positions clearly
before the mind’s eye. <i>Thruster</i> and <i>Retriever</i> were
immediately ahead of the squadron, to starboard and
port respectively, and <i>Sturgeon</i> was ahead of the flotilla,
in the act of crossing from starboard to port. She had
just passed <i>Thruster</i> and was on her port bow, going
towards a point ahead of <i>Retriever</i>, when she sighted the
submarine on her own port bow and therefore almost
enclosed in the triangle formed by the three destroyers.
The U-boat dived immediately, and <i>Sturgeon</i> fired as
she did so, but without effect&mdash;a late shot at a disappearing
target. Lieutenant-Commander Coombs at
once increased to full speed, and altered course to pass
over the position. He arrived accurately, and in time<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213">213</a></span>
to sight the track of the submarine as she tried to
bolt through the only opening left to her, between her
pursuer and the advancing <i>Retriever</i>. Her under-water
speed was quite unequal to this effort, and in a moment
<i>Sturgeon</i> was passing along her track and overhauling
her. Another moment and the destroyer’s depth-charges,
set to forty feet only, were dropped&mdash;one on
either side of the track and a little ahead of it.</p>

<p><i>Sturgeon</i> put her helm over in the usual way to avoid
the explosion area, but turned again on hearing the
detonations and had the satisfaction of seeing the U-boat
shortly afterwards break surface with her bows up at
an ominously high angle. She was by this time near
closing <i>Retriever</i>, but Lieutenant-Commander Coombs
considered her as still his hare. He turned again and
raced for her like a greyhound. She tried to submerge,
but could not get down quickly enough. Every one of
the three destroyers could have rammed her, for as they
came up to her in succession they could all see some
thirty feet of her bows, with hydrophones and net-cutters,
lying almost under them. But there was no
need to take the risks of a concussion&mdash;this was a plain
case for more depth-charges. <i>Sturgeon</i>, as she passed
over a second time, dropped the remainder of hers.
Then came <i>Retriever</i> an instant later, with two more;
and she also dropped a Dan buoy, to mark the exact
spot for <i>Thruster</i>, who was coming across from a greater
distance. By the time <i>Thruster</i> arrived, she found the
U-boat entirely submerged, but she methodically added
her two depth-charges and both of them exploded within
five yards of <i>Retriever’s</i> buoy, and probably not more
from the submarine, which they followed down to
eighty feet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214">214</a></span>
So far, no one had thought of doubting the success
of this very well executed triple attack; and indeed the
evidence was both strong and plentiful. The U-boat
was clearly seen to have been damaged by the <i>Sturgeon’s</i>
first two charges, for she reappeared almost at once
and at an unmistakable angle. The six other charges
dropped over her were none of them blind shots&mdash;<i>Sturgeon</i>
and <i>Retriever</i> both saw their target plainly,
and <i>Thruster</i> had the Dan buoy to guide her. The
Rear-Admiral, in reporting the case, added that he was
himself a witness of the attack and was of opinion that
the submarine was destroyed. As corroborative evidence,
he named the following articles, which were picked
up near the spot: 1 wooden ladder, 1 red <em>kisbie</em> lifebuoy,
1 calcium float, and 1 steel buoy with fractured wire
pendant attached. The lifebuoy and calcium float were
not of British make, and the former was marked
with letters and numbers not used in our Service.
Finally, the area round the Dan buoy was thick with
oil, which came gradually up during the two hours
succeeding the chase.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding this evidence, and the opinion of
so many competent witnesses, the Admiralty rule held
good. There were no survivors or dead bodies, no
debris which might not have come from the submarine’s
deck, no certainty that she could not have righted herself
and crawled home to the repairing yard. The report
was marked ‘Probably sunk,’ and a letter of appreciation
was directed to be forwarded to each of the three
commanders, with an intimation that if any subsequent
information should be received which would cause any
revision of the classification, the case should be resubmitted.
Less than seven weeks afterwards the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215">215</a></span>
‘subsequent information’ was forthcoming and thereupon
Lieutenant-Commander Coombs was awarded the
D.S.O., and ‘Mentions’ were given to Commanders
Taylor and Gibbs, as well as to two ratings from <i>Sturgeon</i>,
and one rating each from <i>Retriever</i> and <i>Thruster</i>. So
ends the plain story of what is, to the Destroyer Service,
a day’s work in the ordinary routine. But any other
Service in the world will tell you that there is nothing
ordinary about it.</p>

<span class="subhead">P-BOATS AND AUXILIARY PATROL</span></h2>
</div>

<p>The trawler is a fishing-boat by birth, and a mine-sweeper
by necessity; the destroyer is first of all a fighting
ship, and a protector of the weak. They will both kill
a submarine when it comes their way; but we have
ships&mdash;classes of ships&mdash;whose whole profession and
occupation it is to hunt the pirate. Their methods
differ as the methods of two kinds of hound. The Q-boat
hunts slowly and craftily, the P-boat and the
Yacht Patrol by speed, the ram, and the dreaded depth-charge.
It is unnecessary to give the technical description
of either class. A yacht is a yacht, and for a P-boat
you may imagine a long slim boat, with fine lines and a
rather low freeboard, three officers, a surgeon, and some
fifty-five men&mdash;depth-charges round the stern and a
gun or two, but no torpedoes.</p>

<p>In September 1917, H.M.S. P.&nbsp;61 received orders to
pick up in a certain roadstead the oiler <i>San Zeferino</i>
and escort her to her destination. It was no easy job;
the <i>San Zeferino’s</i> steering gear was defective, she could
not zigzag; and in the misty showers and very dark
weather prevailing, her course was embarrassingly
original. But she was a valuable ship, and P.&nbsp;61 meant
to get her in if it could be done.</p>

<p>The sea was moderate, but visibility was no more<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217">217</a></span>
than three-quarters of a mile. P.&nbsp;61 kept on the convoy’s
starboard bow and only about two cables ahead,
zigzagging at seventeen knots. At three minutes to
six in the morning, the oiler was suddenly observed to
be settling by the stern. Lieut.-Commander Frank
Arthur Worsley, R.N.R., on the bridge of P.&nbsp;61, had
heard no sound of explosion, and no one in the ship
had sighted a submarine. The Commander knew,
however, that in the thick mist and with a head wind
and wash against him, this was natural enough. He
immediately circled twice round the convoy, signalling
to her: ‘Have you been torpedoed?’ With some
difficulty she replied ‘Yes,’ and also that she had sighted
the submarine.</p>

<p>Lieut.-Commander Worsley ascertained that the
<i>San Zeferino</i> had her boats swung out and was in no
immediate danger. He then reduced speed, in order
not to betray his presence to the enemy, and started
off north-west on the chase. Inevitably he soon lost
sight of the oiler in the fog, and was obliged to turn in
order to regain touch. He found the convoy still heading
on her course, though her engines were wrecked; crossed
her bows, and passed down her port side and under
her stern. Directly P.&nbsp;61 was clear, Lieutenant J.&nbsp;R.
Stenhouse, R.N.R., on her bridge, sighted the enemy
about half a mile away on the starboard beam, heading
westward at nine knots.</p>

<p>Action stations had already been sounded, and fire
was now opened from the port 12-pounder gun. One
round of common shell was sent into the submarine,
striking her just before the conning-tower. But a
gun action was not the final object of P.&nbsp;61. Lieut.-Commander
Worsley had got his engines up to full speed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218">218</a></span>
as he came on, and saw that the enemy could not escape
his ram. So sure was he that, after three minutes’
run, he deliberately stopped both engines, so as to let
the ship’s bows drop deeper in the water and make a
better hit.</p>

<p>The engines stopped, the bows sank two feet, the
order ‘Stand by to ram’ was heard, and P.&nbsp;61 struck the
enemy stem on, on the port side, just abaft the conning-tower.
Her speed at the moment was fully 20 knots,
and the impact was severe; the submarine rolled over
as the stem cut into her; and when P.&nbsp;61’s stern was
just above her, a very violent explosion took place,
giving Lieut.-Commander Worsley, for an instant, the
nightmare that he had been torpedoed by another U-boat
in the moment of victory. He was quickly reassured.
P.&nbsp;61 had suffered no damage. But round the place
of collision the sea was boiling with foam; immense
air-bubbles were coming to the surface in rushes, and
continued for some minutes after the explosion. There
was oil upon the surface, and in it two men struggling.
Lifebelts were thrown to them, and boats put out.
One of the two was rescued and proved to be Ober-Leutnant
Alfred Arnold, the commanding officer of
the U-boat&mdash;the fifth upon the list of 150 published by
the British Admiralty. The submarine was U.C.&nbsp;49
and lies at the bottom in forty-seven fathoms. The
<i>San Zeferino</i> was taken in tow by P.61 and came safely
in after an arduous twelve hours&mdash;an admirable piece
of work. Lieutenant-Commander Worsley received the
D.S.O., Lieutenant Stenhouse the D.S.C., and two petty
officers the D.S.M. for excellent steering and gun-laying.</p>

<p>On this occasion the P-boat had left her patrol duty
for the moment, to act as escort. This was not the case<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219">219</a></span>
with P.&nbsp;57, who had a similar success in November of
the same year. In the dark of early morning, about
6 o’clock, she had just challenged and examined by
searchlight a vessel which turned out to be a friend,
when the forward look-out reported ‘Buoy on the
port bow!’ Course was altered to examine this buoy,
and on approaching it both Lieut.-Commander H.&nbsp;C.
Birnie, R.N.R., in command of P.&nbsp;57, and Lieutenant
Isdale, R.N.R., his officer of the watch, simultaneously
perceived it to be a large U-boat heading due west and
only 200 yards distant.</p>

<p>There was less than no time to be lost. Orders were
given and obeyed instantaneously. The engines leaped
to full speed as the ship came round sharply to port and
steered straight for the enemy. In less than fifteen
seconds the crash came&mdash;a heavy impact, at seventeen
knots, on a point just before the U-boat’s conning-tower,
very nearly at right angles. P.&nbsp;57 cut her way right
through, and as she did so the order for the depth-charges
reached the officer of the watch. The first charge was
released with great promptitude and precision as the
damaged submarine passed under the ship’s stern.
P.&nbsp;57 turned sixteen points and came back over the spot,
when a second charge was immediately dropped and a
buoy put down.</p>

<p>An hour and a half afterwards Lieut.-Commander
Birnie returned, after verifying his position, and
found very large quantities of oil rising about fifty
yards from his buoy. He dropped a third depth-charge
and another buoy, and patrolled the neighbourhood all
night. Sweepers arrived next day, located the U-boat
with a bottom sweep in thirty fathoms, lowered a depth-charge
on the sweep wire and blew the wreck up.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220">220</a></span>
For this ‘speedy and faultless attack’ Lieut.-Commander
Birnie received the D.S.O., Lieutenant Isdale
the D.S.C., and two A.B.’s the D.S.M.</p>

<p>This feat was a remarkable one, for it was performed
in almost total darkness; but success was achieved in
even more difficult circumstances by P.&nbsp;51 towards the
end of March 1918. It was 8.30 in the evening; the
sea was calm under the moonlight, but great spaces of
it were darkened by cloud shadows. The commander,
Lieutenant William Murray, R.N.R., was in the chart-house,
and Mr. Whittel, the gunner, on watch, when the
signalman on the bridge reported a submarine on the
surface, about one point before the port beam and less
than 300 yards away. Orders were at once given to
increase to full speed, and starboard the helm to ram.
As the ship swung, the commander reached the bridge
and took charge. He could see the enemy’s wash and
bow wave. Then she appeared more distinctly as a large
U-boat, 350 feet long, with a huge conning-tower and
about two feet of freeboard showing. P.&nbsp;51 continued
to swing into the desired position and the moment for
a successful ram seemed to have arrived. Then occurred
one of those sudden and unforeseen accidents which
try a commander’s presence of mind and decision to the
utmost. To strike the U-boat fair it was, of course,
necessary to put the helm over as soon as P.&nbsp;51’s head
had swung far enough to be pointing for her, and so
steady the ship on her course. But this order could not
be obeyed&mdash;the helm had jammed. Lieutenant Murray
knew that to struggle with it could only at best result
in a bungling collision which would injure his own ship
rather than the enemy. He made a lightning act
of renunciation, kept his helm a-starboard and swung<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221">221</a></span>
completely round, passing close along the submarine’s
side and then turning altogether away from her. The
helm was soon afterwards found to be acting again;
but in the meantime P.&nbsp;51 had lost sight of the enemy.</p>

<p>She dashed westwards, and in two minutes sighted
the U-boat again, a mile away on the port quarter. A
new ramming attack was immediately planned, and the
guns were ordered to open fire; but the submarine
dived completely before they could pick her up in the
uncertain light. In ten seconds Lieutenant Murray
had brought P.&nbsp;51 over a patch of oil which betrayed the
spot where the U-boat was submerging. Three depth-charges
followed her down. The first two produced the
usual upheaval of water, but the third blew a quantity
of wreckage into the air, of many shapes and sizes.
P.&nbsp;51 continued to circle around, and ten minutes
later three shocks were felt below in rapid succession.
Nothing more was seen, nor could any movement be
heard on the hydrophone.</p>

<p>The official verdict was one of ‘Probably sunk,’
the evidence being considered good but inconclusive.
It was, however, afterwards supplemented by final
proof, and the case was re-marked ‘Known.’ Lieutenant
Murray accordingly received the D.S.C. and two of his
men the D.S.M.</p>

<p>Very little information has been given to the public
about the Yacht Patrol; but it is certain that, when all
is known, the history of this service will be eagerly read.
There is a fine Elizabethan air about the gift of a ship
to the Navy by a private owner, and we can imagine
how keenly the giver would follow the career of his own
boat, longing to command her himself, and glorying to
catch her name now and then through the gales and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222">222</a></span>
rumours and gunfire of the seas, where she is at last
flying the white ensign. Such a gift was the <i>Prize</i>,
who with the heroic Sanders, her Commander, lies
fathoms deep, and still unknown to many; but in time
to come she will be remembered with <i>Farnborough</i>,
<i>Pargust</i> and <i>Dunraven</i>, and her owner’s name will
stand in a unique and honourable list.</p>

<p>Among the victories of the Yacht Patrol, one of the
most timely and decisive was that of May 26, 1918.
H.M. Yacht 024, <i>Lorna</i>, Lieutenant C.&nbsp;L. Tottenham,
R.N.R., was on patrol that day in Lyme Bay, intercepting
east-bound traffic, and keeping an eye at the same time
on the activities of a U-boat off Portland Bill, whom
she intended to deal with when opportunity should offer.
Soon after 8.0 in the evening, she spoke two ships in
succession, the <i>Jabiru</i> and <i>War Cross</i>, and ordered
them both into Weymouth Bay, warning them at the
same time of the enemy submarine. At 8.50 <span class="smcap smaller">P.M.</span> a
lamentable signal came back by wireless&mdash;‘S.O.S.,
S.S.S.S., 2 miles S.W. of Portland Bill, ss. <i>Jabiru</i>,
torpedoed.’</p>

<p><i>Lorna</i> immediately proceeded at full speed, to look
for the sinking ship and give what assistance might be
possible. But, at 9.14 <span class="smcap smaller">P.M.</span>, she intercepted the reassuring
message&mdash;‘Proceeding to port, torpedo missed fire.’
Lieutenant Tottenham at the same moment saw that
<i>War Cross</i>, which had parted only twenty-five minutes
before, had now turned and was steering westward,
having evidently also received the S.O.S. signal from
<i>Jabiru</i>. He altered course and spoke her accordingly,
advising her captain to lay the land, and endeavour to
round the Bill inside the U-boat’s operating radius.
He also offered to go with him as escort, but <i>War Cross</i><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223">223</a></span>
pluckily declined, thinking he could do better by waiting
for darkness and running in by himself.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Tottenham left him and searched the
horizon for another smoke streamer. His game was to
meet every ship which came that way and by closing them
one after another, in the falling dusk, to ensure being
within striking distance when the U-boat should make
the next attempt at assassination. The only success
which could satisfy him would be the destruction of the
enemy before he had had time to strike the ‘live bait’&mdash;an
ambition which showed great nerve, and a grasp of
the principle of the offensive in war. It would have
been easy to make all merchantmen give the Bill a wide
berth, and perhaps save the next ten of them thereby;
but the pest would be active again to-morrow, in the
same place or another&mdash;destruction, at all risks, is the
only cure for U-boats.</p>

<p>Before long another ship was seen approaching from
the south, and <i>Lorna</i> at once headed towards her.
But after steaming for about three and a half miles
on this errand, Lieutenant Tottenham perceived that
the new-comer was already in good hands, or would soon
be so&mdash;the armed drifter <i>Evening Primrose</i> was closing
her, evidently with the intention of acting as escort.
At this moment a fresh ship came in sight, approaching
the Bill from the west. Lieutenant Tottenham instantly
altered course and made straight for her.</p>

<p>At 9.55 <span class="smcap smaller">P.M.</span>, when he had hardly steadied <i>Lorna</i> on
her new course, he sighted the periscope of a submarine.
It was steering due west, almost directly towards the
approaching steamer, and seeing the position of the two
ships, and their converging courses, he assumed rightly
that the enemy was manœuvring for an attack of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224">224</a></span>
usual kind, without warning. Of <i>Lorna’s</i> presence the
U-boat was apparently quite unaware, though she was
now only 150 feet distant and rapidly coming up on the
starboard side of the periscope.</p>

<p>But aware or unaware, the pirates were doomed&mdash;caught
in the act, and helpless as they had thought to
find their victim. <i>Lorna’s</i> helm flew over to starboard.
The ship swung, in one swift curve, through the intervening
fifty yards, and in two minutes from sighting her
enemy she was right over the periscope. The U-boat
dipped, but far too late; as <i>Lorna</i> passed over the spot a
shuddering jar was felt throughout her&mdash;her keel had
struck the conning-tower, but so lightly that the pirates
below probably thought they had escaped destruction
for this time. A moment later they knew their error.
Down came <i>Lorna’s</i> first depth-charge, set to fifty feet.
The helm went over still further to starboard, and the
second charge dropped about fifty feet from the first,
and at the same depth.</p>

<p>Both charges detonated, and it was impossible
to believe that they could have failed to destroy or
seriously cripple the U-boat. They must have exploded
in the most dangerous way possible, just alongside and
underneath the target, where the resistance would be
the maximum. The proof came a few moments afterwards.
While continuing his circle, in order to pass
again over the spot and make sure, Lieutenant Tottenham
suddenly sighted four objects in the water among
the disturbance caused by the two explosions. He
turned and steered direct for the place, expecting to
find wreckage of some kind; but on arriving, at
full speed, he saw an astonishing tumult of water,
caused by an upward rush of air, gas, and oil, which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225">225</a></span>
showed beyond doubt that the U-boat was immediately
below.</p>

<p>The next moment was a terrible one. As <i>Lorna’s</i>
third depth-charge dropped into this seething cauldron,
cries of ‘Kamerad!’ were heard, and those on the
yacht’s deck, looking back as she raced over, saw the
new explosion hurl into the air the bodies of four men,
who for a brief instant had been survivors from the
sunken U-boat. Lieutenant Tottenham eased down
and returned to pick them up. One was found still
crying ‘Help!’ and ‘Kamerad!’ but the other three
were already dead, from the effect of the explosion, or
of the thick mass of oil in which they were submerged.
About the unhappy prisoner there was no doubt.
He was seriously injured internally, and was gone in
three hours’ time. He lived and died in a cruel and
cowardly business, but if care and kindness could have
saved him, <i>Lorna</i> would have brought him into port
and been glad to do it.</p>

<p>This submarine was U.B.&nbsp;74. She was a week out,
and had already sunk three ships when she was caught.
Her commander was Ober-Leutnant Schtiendorf, and
his name will be found in the list of the 150, for his case
was among those marked as ‘Known.’</p>

<p>One more patrol story must be added&mdash;a story in
some ways unique, with mysterious details which haunt
the imagination, but can never be finally explained.
The vessels of the patrol on this occasion were not
yachts, or P-boats in the strict sense of the classification.
One was the <i>Sarba</i>, an armed trawler like those we have
already met, and commanded by Lieutenant George G.
Astbury, R.N.R.; the other was a small boat, with no
name but T.B.&nbsp;055, commanded by Gunner T. H. Britton.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226">226</a></span>
On the morning of October 31, 1917, T.B.&nbsp;055 was
accompanying the trawlers who were engaged in sweeping
an important channel outside a British harbour.
At 3.0 <span class="smcap smaller">P.M.</span> when the sweep was practically over, Mr.
Britton noticed an oil track on the surface of the channel.
This was in itself an astonishing sight, and not to be
accounted for in a moment. How could a submarine
have ventured into a channel only thirteen fathoms
deep, and daily swept by a highly efficient force of
trawlers? And for what possible reason could she be
lying there on the bottom at 3 o’clock in the afternoon,
in a position where she could use none of her weapons,
and was certain to be found and attacked?</p>

<p>Mr. Britton went into the oil track to investigate;
stopped his boat and listened on the hydrophone.
His astonishment was redoubled&mdash;the submarine was
there, and not only there, but busy and audible. The
case was so extraordinary that he and his trained
hydrophone listener took counsel together and classified
the sounds they heard. First there were the usual
‘water noises’; these were continuous and perfectly
familiar. Secondly, there was an almost continuous
high-pitched sound, somewhat similar to that of a
turbine engine running. Thirdly, at intervals of a few
seconds, came a noise as of knocking or hammering
upon metal; the speed of the tapping varied from slow
to fairly rapid blows. Lastly&mdash;and this was the most
unexpected and mysterious of all&mdash;on two occasions
there was audible, over all the other noises, a sound as
of wireless letters on a high musical note.</p>

<p>For three minutes these sounds were heard, noted,
and compared. T.B.&nbsp;055 was then taken forward
about 200 yards, to the end of the oil track, and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227">227</a></span>
hydrophone was used again. Precisely the same
sounds were heard, except that this time the musical
note, as of a wireless message, was not repeated. Mr.
Britton had no desire to lose time; but he was not
troubled with nerves, and he was determined to make
sure of his evidence. He took precautions to stop all
ship’s noises. The fact only became clearer that the
sounds below came from a live submarine. What
her crew were doing no one could know; but she was
there for an evil purpose, and she must pay the penalty.</p>

<p>The oil was still coming up in a visible thin stream
from below the surface. T.B.&nbsp;055 dropped a Reindeer
buoy with moorings, to mark the spot exactly, got under
way and came back over the position. As she passed,
a depth-charge was dropped. The tide was fairly slack
at the time, and there was every reason to believe that
it found the target. Mr. Britton returned to the spot
once more. The volume of oil rising had now increased,
and a strong smell of oil fuel was noticed, which had
not been there before. The blobs of oil which now
came to the surface had brownish air-bubbles and froth
among them; in the hydrophone, nothing was to be
heard but the ordinary water noises.</p>

<p>It was now 3.35 <span class="smcap smaller">P.M.</span>, and the armed trawler <i>Sarba</i>
was seen approaching. Mr. Britton reported what he
had been doing to Lieutenant Astbury, who at once
stopped his own engines and used his hydrophone.
Then, as he too could hear no sign of life, he took a sounding,
found sixteen fathoms and a sandy bottom, and
decided that the enemy must be still there, alive or
dead. Accordingly he steamed clear of the position,
turned and came back over it at full speed. He determined
to set his depth-charge for eighty feet, in spite of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228">228</a></span>
the shallowness of the water, because, with the boat on
the bottom at ninety-six feet, he would be absolutely
certain of getting a very close explosion. The charge
detonated, and he returned at once to the spot. Large
bubbles of air and quantities of oil were coming up, and
within a short time the oil was covering a very wide
area. Sarba stood by all night, using her hydrophone
frequently.</p>

<p>It was now evident that the enemy was dead; but
the more the circumstances were reflected upon, the
more difficult it was to explain them. Next morning,
when T.B.&nbsp;055 had ‘proceeded to sea in accordance with
programme,’ Lieutenant Astbury, in <i>Sarba</i>, was left
alone, with nothing but two buoys and an oil patch to
give so incredible a story any kind of reality. He got
out a sweep wire with a sinker of 1¾ cwt. and took a
sweep along the position. The sweep brought up on
an immovable obstruction, and the incredible seemed
once more possible. At 2.0 <span class="smcap smaller">P.M.</span> arrived the armed
drifter <i>Sunshine</i> and T.B.&nbsp;058. They found <i>Sarba</i>
lying as near as possible in the position where she had
exploded her depth-charge, and where her sweep had
brought her up. They took a ground sweep under her,
and their sweep wire also fouled the same obstruction.
<i>Sarba</i>, like a faithful dog, remained on guard during the
following night. At last, at 2.30 <span class="smcap smaller">P.M.</span> on November 2,
the divers arrived.</p>

  <img src="images/i_229.jpg" width="412" height="600" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">‘The diver who first went down found the submarine lying on her side.’</div></div>

<p>Before the day was out, all uncertainty was removed.
The diver who first went down found the submarine
lying on her side. When visited a second time, she had
been righted by the tide or some shifting of weight; but
she and all her crew were dead. The main fact was thus
proved; but the mystery remained and still remains<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229">229</a><a class="hidev" id="Page_230">230</a></span>
inexplicable and haunting. Possibly the answer, to
the first of the two questions involved, may be a simple
one. The U-boat may have got into the channel in a
fog, and finding herself there when the weather cleared,
she may have dived for safety and decided to remain
on the bottom till it was dark enough to steal away.
But the sounds cannot be explained to the satisfaction
of those who know most about submarine war. The
U-boat commander must have realised the enormous
risk he was incurring, when he allowed those noises to be
made at such an hour of day. He must have known
that the British Patrol is well equipped with hydrophones,
with depth-charges, and with sweeps. Either
he had some serious injury to repair, and no time to
wait; or else his boat was completely disabled at the
bottom, and the hammering and other noises were the
desperate attempts of the crew to draw attention in the
hope of being rescued. ‘There is also,’ said the Admiral
of the station, ‘the third possibility, that the boat
carries inside her a tragedy that will never be known.’</p>

</div>

<p>Everyone who has ever thought about war must know
that secrecy is one of the first conditions of military
success, whether on land or sea. Yet the secrecy practised
by our Government and our Higher Command
has often been the subject of complaint. The complaint
is not the cry of mere sensationalism or curiosity,
deprived of its ration of news. Often it is the most
patriotic and intelligent who are the most distressed at
being kept in the dark. They understand the dangers
of a great war, and they desire, above all things, not
to live in a fool’s paradise. They know that they can
bear to hear the worst, and they feel that they deserve
to hear the best. The anti-submarine campaign
has especially tried their patience. There has been great
anxiety to know the exact figures of our mercantile
losses; and on the other hand, when naval honours have
been given without the usual account of the actions by
which they were earned, there has been a tendency
to grumble that we are not being helped to bear the
strain of war, even when events are in our favour.</p>

<p>These complaints are not justified. Those who make
them have failed to realise the deadly earnestness of
the struggle we are carrying on. It is hard on the
patriotic student of war that we should go short of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232">232</a></span>
facts, and hard on the anxious that they should lack
encouraging information; but how much harder would
it be for our seamen and submarine crews, if the secret
of their tactics were given away to an enemy only too
quick to take advantage of what he can succeed in
overhearing? When one interesting paragraph in a
newspaper may possibly mean the sacrifice of many
lives, what statesman or staff officer would take the
responsibility of passing it for publication? But the
secrets of the Admiralty in this war have not been
timidly or unintelligently kept. In spite of the tradition
of ‘the Silent Service’&mdash;which only means that ‘the
Navy doesn’t advertise’&mdash;there is no general feeling
against telling the truth and the whole truth, when it
can be done to the advantage of the country. Those in
power have been for the most part in favour of ‘taking
the lid off’ when the right time has come; and in
this very matter of the mysterious honours, it was the
First Lord himself who at last told the public what
could no longer be valuable information for the enemy.
So long as the use of disguised Special Service ships,
or Q-boats, was a new method, indispensable to us
and unsuspected by the Germans, or at least unfamiliar
to them, so long was it highly undesirable that we
should speak or write publicly of their successes. But
now that after many losses, and some escapes, from
Q-boats, the enemy’s submarine service has found out
all their secrets, our own Navy has naturally ceased to
rely on this kind of surprise, and has invented new
devices, even more deadly and more difficult to evade.
Of these we are, very reasonably, forbidden to write;
but of the old and well-known hunting methods&mdash;of
the work of destroyers, patrol-boats, trawlers, submarines,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233">233</a></span>
aircraft and Q-boats&mdash;we may now give illustrations;
for we shall be telling nothing that the enemy
does not know to his cost already. The very name,
Q-boat, is as familiar in Germany as in this country.
The submarine which escaped from the <i>Dunraven</i> carried
away a very complete understanding of the work of
these Special Service ships, and the <cite>Illustrierte Zeitung</cite>
of July 12, 1917, contained a full description of a
fight between a U-boat and a ‘submarine trap,’
which took place on February 22 of that year.</p>

<p>It is evident from this, and other articles of a similar
kind, that, in German opinion, it is the U-boats,
and not their victims, who have the right to complain
of barbarous treatment. This view is amazing; but it
is in complete accordance with the principle laid down
by Major-General von Disfurth, in the <cite>Hamburger
Nachrichten</cite>, at the beginning of the War: ‘We owe no
explanations to anyone: there is nothing for us to
justify, and nothing for us to explain away. Every
act, of whatever nature, committed by our troops for
the purpose of discouraging, defeating and destroying
our enemies, is a brave act, a good deed, and fully
justified. Germany stands supreme, the arbiter of
her own methods, which must in time of war be dictated
to the world.’ That is the insolence of unmitigated
brutality, and the British Navy took up the
challenge with a spirit that will set the standard of
the world so long as war remains a possibility in human
life. If our men had retaliated on barbarians by
methods of barbarism, neither the German Government,
as Sir Edward Grey pointed out, nor the German
people, would have had any just ground for complaint.
‘It is not in consideration for their deserts that the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234">234</a></span>
Admiralty reject such a policy. They reject it because
it is inconsistent with the traditions of the Service for
which they are responsible; nor do they now propose
to alter their methods of warfare merely because they
find themselves in conflict with opponents whose views
of honour and humanity are different from their own.’
But within the old rules, the rules of law and chivalry,
they are right to use every device that native ingenuity
and centuries of experience can suggest. There is no
German cunning that cannot be matched by British
science and discipline, and no German brutality that
cannot be overmatched by British daring and endurance.
This has been proved a hundred times in the
course of the submarine war, and never more brilliantly
than by the captains of the Q-boats, of whom
the pattern for all time is Gordon Campbell, till yesterday
known only as ‘The Mystery Star Captain’ of the
British Navy.</p>

<p>In 1915, Gordon Campbell was just one of the many
Lieutenant-Commanders who had never had an opportunity
for distinguished service. His hopes rose when
he was appointed to command the <i>Farnborough</i>, a
Special Service ship, formerly a collier, with crew mainly
drawn from the mercantile marine and R.N.R. Into
these men he infused his own ideas of discipline and
training, as well as his own cool and selfless courage.
During the whole winter the <i>Farnborough</i> faced the
gales without a single fight to cheer her; but never for
a moment did her commander waver in his faith that
her chance would come, and never did his men cease
to give him their whole trust and devotion. In the
end, he was able to say of them that they understood
every move in the game as well as he himself did, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235">235</a></span>
played it with the same keenness. Even if he had met
with no other success, this alone was an achievement,
and a proof of invaluable power. But other successes
were to be added&mdash;the power was to be felt beyond
his own ship, as an example and an inspiration.</p>

<p>The <i>Farnborough’s</i> first chance came in the spring of
1916, when she was tramping quietly along at eight
knots. Her look-out sighted the enemy at last&mdash;a submarine
awash, and about five miles distant on the port
bow. It remained in view only for a few minutes and
then dived, no doubt for the attack. It was the
<i>Farnborough’s</i> part to be blind, stupid, and generally
mercantile. She maintained her course and speed as
if she had observed nothing. Twenty minutes later
a torpedo was seen coming up on the starboard
quarter. The bubbles rose right under the forecastle,
the torpedo having evidently passed just ahead of the
ship. The <i>Farnborough</i> maintained her course, as blind
and trampish as before.</p>

<p>A few minutes more, and the U-boat, convinced
that she had a fool to deal with, broke surface only a
thousand yards astern of the ship, passing across her
wake from starboard to port. But she was not exactly
in a mood of reckless courage&mdash;she fired a shot from
her gun across <i>Farnborough’s</i> bows, and at the same
time partially submerged. Now came the moment
for which Lieutenant-Commander Campbell had trained
his men. He stopped, blew off steam ostentatiously,
and ordered a ‘panic abandon ship’ by his stokers
and spare men, under Engineer Sub-Lieutenant John
Smith, R.N.R. The U-boat was encouraged by this,
closed to 800 yards, and a few seconds later reopened
fire with a shell which fell about fifty yards short. Then,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236">236</a></span>
in the traditional style of the old Navy, the captain
gave the order to hoist the white ensign and open fire.</p>

<p>The surprise was complete and overwhelming; the
pirate made no fight of it at all. <i>Farnborough</i> fired
twenty-one rounds from her three 12-pounders, one of
the guns getting off 13 rounds to her own share; and
the Maxims and rifles also expended some 200 cartridges.
The range was long, considering the bad light,
but several hits were observed before the submarine
disappeared. She went down slowly. Lieutenant-Commander
Campbell steamed full speed over the spot and
dropped a depth-charge. Immediately the U-boat reappeared.
She was only ten yards off the ship, and
rose in a nearly perpendicular position, being out of the
water from the bow to abaft the conning-tower. She
had had one periscope hit, and there was a large rent
in her bow, through which no doubt the water had
penetrated and run down into her stern compartment,
giving her her unnatural position. All this was remembered
and told afterwards. Her reappearance was
instantly greeted with five more rounds from the <i>Farnborough’s</i>
after-gun. They all went into the base of
the conning-tower at point-blank range, and she sank
at once. Oil, not in driblets but in very large quantities,
came rapidly to the surface, mixed with pieces of wood,
and covered the sea for some distance round. <i>Farnborough</i>
collected her boats and stokers, and reported
her success&mdash;a success insured, as was noted on her
report, by ‘good nerve and thorough organisation.’</p>

<p>Three weeks afterwards, she heard of a U-boat
operating on a definite pitch of her own, and set out
to put temptation in her way. In the evening, as she
was going warily along at five knots, on a calm and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237">237</a></span>
misty sea, she observed a ship on her starboard quarter,
about two miles distant. Then suddenly, between
the two vessels, a submarine broke surface. The blind
old <i>Farnborough</i> plodded on, taking no notice till the
U-boat hoisted a signal, which Commander Campbell
could not read. He stopped, however, and blew off
steam, with his answering pendant at the dip. He also
hoisted the signal ‘Cannot understand your signal,’
but kept jogging ahead, so as to edge in, and to avoid
falling into the trough of the heavy swell. The U-boat
was lying full length on the surface. She was a large
boat and had two guns on deck, but no men visible.</p>

<p>Presently she began to close, and manned her
foremost gun. In the meantime Commander Campbell
had turned out the bridge boat and given his ‘papers’
to Engineer Sub-Lieutenant John Smith, R.N.R., to
take over to the submarine. At this moment the
enemy fired a shot, which passed over the ship, and one
of the <i>Farnborough’s</i> gunners, thinking that his own
ship had opened the engagement, began to fire himself.
This forced Commander Campbell’s hand; he ran up
the white ensign, gave the general order to open fire,
and went full speed ahead to bring his after-gun to bear.
The range was a long one for a misty evening&mdash;900
to 1,000 yards&mdash;but the shooting was good enough.
The second shot was seen by the neutral sailors on
the other ship to strike the U-boat directly; her bow
submerged and her stern came up out of the water so
that her propellers were visible, and one of them could
be seen to be higher than the other. She lay in this
position for a good five minutes, and altogether 20
rounds were fired at her from the <i>Farnborough’s</i> 12-pounders,
the last two of which hit either on the conning-<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238">238</a></span>tower
or just forward of it. Then there appeared to be an
explosion on board the U-boat, and she sank suddenly.
There was a great commotion on the water, and a cloud
of dense steam or vapour covered the surface for some
minutes. <i>Farnborough</i> passed over the spot and dropped
two depth-charges; but the submarine had gone to
the bottom in 81 fathoms and nothing more was seen
of her. The neutral ship afterwards observed a large
patch of oil upon the surface. She had behaved with
strict neutrality, and was good enough to remain
some time on the spot, ‘looking for drowneds,’ but
she looked in vain.</p>

<p>By the destruction of these two U-boats, Commander
Campbell and his ship’s company had done valuable
service, and had given remarkable proof of what can be
accomplished by discipline and nerve. But the very
efficiency and success of their work gave a deceptive
appearance to it. The fighting was so smartly done,
and so conclusive, that it looked an easier thing than it
really was, to trap and sink a brace of pirates in three
weeks. The enemy was not long in perceiving that the
trade of murder was being rapidly made more difficult
and more dangerous for him. Every time a U-boat
came home, the need for caution was more strongly
impressed upon the directors of the campaign.</p>

<p>The German Press was instructed to complain that
the unscrupulous British Navy was using disguised
ships and depth-charges against the Power which ‘stands
supreme, the arbiter of her own methods,’ and has
alone the right to dress her <i>Greifs</i> and <i>Moewes</i> as unarmed
neutral trading vessels. At the same time the
pirate captains were ordered to be less rash in approaching
ships they had torpedoed but had not sunk outright.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239">239</a></span>
The result was to make Commander Campbell’s next
encounter a much more anxious affair, and it was
only by his incredible patience and judgment, and the
wonderful discipline of his crew, that their third victory
was achieved. As to the courage of every one concerned,
it would be waste of time to speak of it. Courage
of the finest quality was the very breath which these
men breathed&mdash;all day, and every day.</p>

<p>One morning, then, early in 1917, the Special Service
ship Q.&nbsp;5 was going due east at 7 knots, when a torpedo
was seen approaching her starboard beam. This was
what Commander Campbell was out for&mdash;in the present
timid state of the pirates’ nerves, there was no hope of
drawing any of them into a fight, except by getting
torpedoed outright, to start with. They might approach
a sinking ship&mdash;they would no longer venture to come
near a live one. But, at the same time, one need not
make the handicap unnecessarily heavy. Commander
Campbell valued his men’s lives at least as much as
his own, and he did his best to save his heroic engine-room
staff, who faced the worst of the danger with
perfect understanding and perfect self-sacrifice. He
put his helm hard aport, and was so far successful that
he received the torpedo in No. 3 hold; but, to his regret,
it burst the bulk-head between that hold and the engine-room
and slightly wounded Engineer Sub-Lieutenant
John Smith, R.N.R. Help, he knew, was not far off;
but no signal was sent out, for fear some zealous ship
might arrive before Q.&nbsp;5 had done her work. ‘Action’
was sounded, and all hands went quietly to stations
previously arranged for such an emergency. Every
man, except those required on board for the fight, then
abandoned ship&mdash;two lifeboats and one dinghey full<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240">240</a></span>
were sent away, and a fourth boat was partially lowered
with a proper amount of confusion. The chief engineer
reported the engine-room filling with water. He was
ordered to hang on as long as possible, and then hide.</p>

<div id="if_i_241" class="figcenter" style="width: 475px;">
  <img src="images/i_241.jpg" width="402" height="600" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">‘A fourth boat was partially lowered with a proper amount of confusion.’</div></div>

<p>While all this was going on&mdash;and a most masterly
piece of acting it was, the whole company playing
perfectly together&mdash;the U-boat was observed on the
starboard quarter watching the proceedings through
his periscope. His carcass he was loth to expose, but
he came past the ship on the starboard side, only five
yards from the lifeboats, and ten from the ship; so
close, in fact, that though still submerged, the whole
hull of the submarine could be seen distinctly through
the water. The temptation to fire was almost unbearable.
But the effect upon the U-boat at that
depth was very doubtful, and there would be no time
for a second shot before he slid down out of reach.
Commander Campbell made no sign, and his gunners
lay as steady as if his hand were upon them.</p>

<p>Their patience was repaid. Twenty minutes after
firing his torpedo, the enemy passed across the ship’s
bow and ventured to the surface to finish her off. He
was 300 yards away on the port bow when Q.&nbsp;5 made
the signal ‘Torpedoed.’ He then came down past
the port side on the surface, captain on conning-tower,
ready to give sentence of death on his victim. But as
he came onto the precise bearing on which all Q.&nbsp;5’s
guns could bear, Commander Campbell gave the order
to open fire at point-blank range.</p>

<p>The 6-pounder got in first, with a shell which hit
the conning-tower and removed the pirate captain’s
head. The U-boat never recovered from the surprise but
lay on the surface while the British gunners shattered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241">241</a><a class="hidev" id="Page_242">242</a></span>
his hull. The conning-tower was naturally the chief
mark. It was repeatedly hit, some of the shells going
apparently clean through it. When the boat sank, the
conning-tower was shattered and lay completely open,
with the crew trying to escape by it to the deck. Commander
Campbell ordered ‘Cease fire,’ and sent one
of his lifeboats to their assistance. But the swirl of the
sinking vessel, and the density of the oil which poured
out of her, proved immediately fatal to those who had
succeeded in reaching the water. One officer was picked
up alive, and one man.</p>

<div id="if_i_245" class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
  <img src="images/i_245.jpg" width="600" height="329" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><p>‘The U-boat never recovered from the surprise.’</p></div>
  <p class="captionr">[<i>See page</i> <a href="#Page_240">240</a>.
  </p></div>

<p>Commander Campbell then recalled his boats and
inspected his ship, with what feelings only a seaman
can imagine. He found that Q.&nbsp;5 was sinking by the
stern. The engine- and boiler-rooms were rapidly filling,
and the water was also pouring into three holds. After
making the signal for assistance, he placed all hands
in the boats, except a chosen few whom he kept on
board with him; and as the case was desperate, he
gave orders for the destruction of all confidential
books and charts.</p>

<p>An hour and a half later the <i>Narwhal</i> arrived, and
took all the crew on board. Commander Campbell
himself&mdash;dead set on saving his ship if it could be done&mdash;inspected
her once more, and then went over to the
<i>Narwhal</i> to discuss the possibility of towage. Shortly
afterwards the <i>Buttercup</i> came up, and as Q.&nbsp;5 seemed
by now to have assumed a more stable position and the
water was gaining more slowly, Commander Campbell
ordered <i>Buttercup</i> to take her in tow, which was done
in the most seamanlike manner. It was a long and
difficult business, almost desperate at times. First the
tow parted, owing to Q.&nbsp;5’s helm being jammed hard<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243">243</a></span>
over and immovable&mdash;the result of explosion. But
her commander was not defeated. He was hard at work
raising steam in her donkey-boiler, so as to be able to
steer and veer cable. After four hours he got her in
tow again, and she towed fairly well. But water was
still gaining; the swell was breaking over the decks,
and the after gun-house was at times under water.</p>

<p>Another ship, <i>Laburnum</i>, was now standing by, and
at dusk suggested that Commander Campbell and his
men should come on board for the night; but they
refused to give up their ship as long as they could steer
her. About two hours after midnight the end seemed
to have come; Q.&nbsp;5 suddenly started to list, the water
gained rapidly, the donkey boiler-room was flooded,
and the helm could no longer be used. At 3.30 Commander
Campbell put the helm amidships, and ordered
his men aboard <i>Laburnum</i>. He then followed himself,
but returned to his own ship at daybreak and resumed
towing; then, finding her in a very critical condition,
he was compelled to go back to <i>Laburnum</i> for the time.</p>

<p>In the evening, when they were at last nearing port,
the trawler <i>Luneta</i> came out to help. Q.&nbsp;5 had by now
nearly twenty degrees of list, and her stern was nearly
eight feet under water; but she was brought in after all,
and we may take her commander’s word for it that her
safe arrival in harbour was due to the splendid seamanship
of Lieutenant-Commander W.&nbsp;W. Hallwright of
the <i>Laburnum</i>. In an achievement like this, there is
a romantic touch of the old tradition&mdash;it was by just
such seamanship that our frigate captains saved the
Fleet after Trafalgar.</p>

<p>We may hear, too, what the commander of Q.&nbsp;5 said
about his officers and crew. ‘They may almost be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244">244</a></span>
said to have passed through the supreme test of
discipline. The chief-engineer and the engine-room
watch remained at their posts and kept the dynamos
going until driven out by water. They then had to
hide on top of the engine-room. The guns’ crews had
to remain concealed in their gun-houses for nearly half
an hour, while we could feel the ship going down by
the stern. At that time it appeared touch-and-go
whether the ship would sink before we sank the enemy.
The officers and men who remained on board during
the towing also did splendidly, the conditions at times
being most dangerous ... it is difficult to select individuals
where all did so well.’ But without selecting,
we may name two by their names: Engineer-Lieutenant
L.&nbsp;S. Loveless, R.N.R., and Lieutenant
Ronald Stuart, R.N.R., First and Gunnery Lieutenant,
both now members of the Distinguished Service Order.
It is hardly necessary to add that their commander
received the Victoria Cross. He was born for it.</p>

<p>It is not often that any man, or any ship’s company,
can repeat their best performance and better it; yet
Commander Campbell’s third victory was followed by
a fourth, of which, as the Admiral on his station said
truly, it is difficult to speak in sober terms. Four
months after Q.&nbsp;5 had struggled back to port, her men
were out again in the <i>Pargust</i>, a merchant vessel on
the same Special Service. The ship was going 8 knots
in heavy rain and mist, with a fresh southerly breeze
and a choppy sea. Like Q.&nbsp;5, she got what she was
looking for&mdash;what others run fast and far to avoid.
A torpedo was seen coming towards her on the starboard
beam. It was apparently fired at very close range,
for it had not yet settled down to its depth, but jumped<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245">245</a><a class="hidev" id="Page_246">246</a></span>
out of the water when only a hundred yards from
the ship. This time there was no choice, and no
manœuvring; <i>Pargust</i> received the shot in the engine-room
and near the water-line. It made a large rent,
filled the boiler-room, the engine-room and No. 5 hold
with water, killed a stoker, wounded Engineer Sub-Lieutenant
John Smith, R.N.R., and blew the starboard
lifeboat into the air, landing pieces of it on the aerial.</p>

<p>The alarm had already been sounded and ‘Abandon
ship’ ordered. The three remaining boats&mdash;one lifeboat
and two dinghies&mdash;were lowered, full of men, the
ship’s helm being put hard a-starboard to get a lee for
them. Lieutenant F.&nbsp;R. Hereford, R.N.R., as before,
went in charge of them and greatly distinguished himself
by the coolness and propriety with which he acted the
part of Master of the supposed merchantman.</p>

<p>As the last boat was pushing off, the enemy’s periscope
was seen for the first time, just before the port
beam, and about 400 yards from the ship. He turned
and came straight on; but ten minutes later, when only
50 yards from the ship and close to the stern of the
lifeboat, he submerged completely and disappeared.
His periscope was sighted again a few minutes later,
directly astern; he then steamed to the starboard
quarter, turned round and went across to the port beam,
turned again towards the ship and lifeboat, and finally,
after all this nosing about, broke surface within 50
yards or less. But even now he was extremely cautious,
showing only his conning-tower and ends; and when
the lifeboat pulled away round the ship’s stern, he
followed close behind, with only one man visible on
top of the conning-tower, shouting directions to those
below.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247">247</a></span>
For the next three minutes of this long game of
patience, the strain was intense. Commander Campbell
was watching the man on the conning-tower carefully,
for as long as he saw him perched up there he knew that
he could reserve his fire. Lieutenant Hereford was
waiting till he was certain that his captain was in a
winning position. As soon as that was attained, he
pulled deliberately towards the ship. This annoyed
the submarine, whose object was evidently, in case of a
fight, to keep the boats as much as possible in the line
of fire. He came right up to the surface and began to
semaphore to the boats, at the same time training a
Maxim on them.</p>

<p>But by this time the U-boat was only one point
before the ship’s beam, with all guns bearing on him
at 50 yards’ range&mdash;Commander Campbell’s chance had
come. He opened fire with a shot from the 4-inch gun,
which struck the base of the conning-tower and also
removed the two periscopes. Hit after hit followed,
nearly all in the conning-tower, which could no longer
be closed. The submarine took a list to port, and several
men rushed up, out of the hatch abaft the conning-tower.
Then, as the stern began to sink and oil squirted from
the boat’s sides, the rest of the crew came out, held
up their hands and waved in token of surrender.
Commander Campbell, of course, ordered ‘Cease fire’;
but no sooner had the order been obeyed, than the pirate
started to move off on the surface, hoping, though
listing to port and down by the stern, and in honour
bound a prisoner, to get away in the mist. The
<i>Pargust</i> could not follow, so that she was obliged to
open fire again. The U-boat’s breach of faith did not
save her. In her quick rush, she got to about 300 yards<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248">248</a></span>
from her captor, whose guns continued to speak straight
to her. Then a shot apparently touched off one of
her torpedoes&mdash;there was an explosion forward, and
she fell over on her side. For a moment her bow
was seen jutting up sharply out of the water, and the
next she was gone.</p>

<p>In her reckless rush to escape she had washed
overboard her men abaft the conning-tower; one man
went down clinging to her bow, and some who came up
the fore-hatch were left struggling in the thick oil.
The boats of the <i>Pargust</i> were sent to the rescue. They
had a hard pull to windward in a choppy sea; but they
managed to save the only two whom they found alive.
The <i>Pargust</i> lay tossing helplessly for nearly four hours.
Then H.M.S. <i>Crocus</i> arrived and towed her into port,
escorted by another of H.M.’s ships and the U.S.S.
<i>Cushing</i>.</p>

<p>‘It is difficult,’ says Commander Campbell, ‘where
all did well, to mention individual officers and men,
as any one officer or man could easily have spoiled
the show. It was a great strain for those on board
to have to remain entirely concealed for thirty-five
minutes after the ship was torpedoed&mdash;especially, for
instance, the foremost gun’s crew, who had to remain
flat on the deck without moving a muscle.’ And the
actual combatants were not the only heroes; for he
adds: ‘The men in the boats, especially the lifeboat,
ran a great risk of being fired on by me if the submarine
closed them.’</p>

<p>It is difficult for a grateful country, difficult even
for the most generously sympathetic of sovereigns,
to deal adequately with a ship’s company like this.
Every man on board had already been mentioned or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249">249</a></span>
decorated, most of them more than once, and by the
very names of their successive ships they were already
marked out for lasting honour. Still, for our sake
rather than for theirs, we may be glad to know that
what tokens could be given them, were given. First,
Commander Campbell became a Captain, and others
were promoted in their various ranks. Then the
memorable thirteenth clause of the Statutes of the
Victoria Cross was put into operation. By this it is
ordained that in the event of a gallant and daring act
having been performed by a ship’s company, or other
body of men, in which the Admiral, General, or other
officer commanding such forces may deem that all are
equally brave and distinguished, then the officer commanding
may direct that one officer shall be selected,
by the officers engaged, for the decoration; and in
like manner, one man shall be selected by the seamen
or private soldiers, for the decoration. Knowing as
we do what Captain Campbell felt about his officers
and men, we can imagine something of his satisfaction
at being able to recommend that the V.C. should be worn
on behalf of the whole ship’s company by Lieutenant
R.&nbsp;N. Stuart, D.S.O., R.N.R., and by seaman William
Williams, D.S.M., R.N.R. The latter, when one of the
gun ports was damaged by the shock of the torpedo,
saved it from falling down and exposing the whole
secret of the ship, by bearing at great personal risk
and with great presence of mind the whole weight of the
port until assistance could be given him. The former
was the Captain’s first-lieutenant and second self.
These two crosses, and his high rank, were the Captain’s
own reward; but to mark the occasion, a bar was also
added to his D.S.O.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250">250</a></span>
To these men there was now but one thing wanting&mdash;to
show their greatness in adversity: and Fortune,
that could deny nothing to Gordon Campbell, gave him
this too. Less than two months after the <i>Pargust’s</i>
action he was at sea in the Special Service ship <i>Dunraven</i>,
disguised as an armed British merchant vessel, and
zigzagging at eight knots in rough water. A submarine
was sighted on the horizon two points before the starboard
beam; but the zigzag course was maintained,
and the enemy steered towards the ship, submerging
about twenty minutes after she was first seen. Twenty-six
minutes later she broke surface on the starboard
quarter at 5,000 yards, and opened fire. Captain
Campbell at once ran up the white ensign, returned
the fire with his after-gun, a 2½-pounder, and ordered
the remainder of the crew to take ‘shell cover.’ He
also gave directions for much smoke to be made, but
at the same time reduced speed to seven knots, with
an occasional zigzag, to give the U-boat a chance of
closing. If he had been the merchantman he seemed,
he could in all probability have escaped. He was
steaming head to sea, and the submarine’s firing was
very poor, the shots nearly all passing over.</p>

<p>After about half an hour the enemy ceased firing
and came on at full speed. A quarter of an hour
later he turned broadside on, and reopened fire. The
<i>Dunraven’s</i> gun kept firing short, intentionally, and
signals were made <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">en clair</i> for the U-boat’s benefit,
such as ‘Submarine chasing and shelling me’&mdash;‘Submarine
overtaking me. Help. Come quickly!’&mdash;and
finally, ‘Am abandoning ship.’ The shells soon began
to fall closer. Captain Campbell made a cloud of steam
to indicate boiler trouble, and ordered ‘Abandon ship,’<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251">251</a></span>
at the same time stopping, blowing off steam, and turning
his broadside so that all he did should be visible.
To add to the appearance of panic, a boat was let go
by the foremost fall on its side. The pirate (thoroughly
confident now) closed, and continued his shelling.
One shell went through <i>Dunraven’s</i> poop, exploding
a depth-charge and blowing Lieutenant Charles Bonner,
D.S.C., R.N.R., out of his control station. After two
more shells into the poop, the U-boat ceased fire again
and closed. He was ‘coming along very nicely’ from
port to starboard, so as to pass four or five hundred
yards away. But in the meantime, the poop was on
fire. Clouds of dense black smoke were issuing from
it and partially hiding the submarine. It was obvious
to Captain Campbell that since the magazine and depth-charges
were in the poop, an explosion must soon take
place. He was faced with the choice of opening fire
through the smoke, with a poor chance of success,
or waiting till the enemy should have got on to the
weather side. He decided to wait, trusting his men
as faithfully as they were trusting him.</p>

<p>The U-boat came on, but all too slowly. She was
only just passing across <i>Dunraven’s</i> stern when the
dreaded explosion took place in the poop. The 4-inch
gun and gun’s crew complete were blown into the air.
The gun landed forward on the well deck, and the crew
in various places&mdash;one man in the water. This was a
misfortune that might well have broken their captain’s
heart&mdash;the submarine had only to steam another 200
yards, and he would have had a clear sight and three
guns bearing on her at 400 yards range. Moreover
the explosion had started the ‘Open fire’ buzzers at
the guns; and the gun on the bridge, which was the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252">252</a></span>
only one then bearing, had duly opened fire. The
U-boat had already started to submerge, alarmed by
the explosion; but it was thought that one hit was
obtained on the conning-tower as he disappeared.</p>

<p>Captain Campbell’s heart was not broken, nor was
his natural force abated. Realising that a torpedo would
probably come next, he ordered the doctor, Surgeon-probationer
Alexander Fowler, D.S.C., R.N.V.R., to
remove all the wounded and lock them up in cabins
or elsewhere, so as not to risk detection in ‘the next
part.’ He then turned hoses on to the flaming poop,
where, though the deck was red hot, the magazine was
apparently still intact and dangerous. At the same
time he remembered that a man-of-war had answered
his signal for assistance when the explosion took place;
and being determined on trying for a second fight, he
now signalled to this ship to keep away, as the action
was not yet ended. She not only kept away, but kept
the ring, by deflecting traffic while these invincibles
fought the pirate to a finish.</p>

<p>The torpedo came at last, from a point about 1,000
yards on the starboard side, and it struck abaft the
engine-room. Captain Campbell at once ordered a
second ‘Abandon ship’ or ‘Q abandon ship,’ as he
called it; for by it he was professing to completely
abandon a ship whose disguise had been detected. He
left his guns visible, and sent a second party of men
away on a raft and a damaged boat. The poop continued
to burn fiercely, and 4-inch shells exploded every
few minutes. The submarine put up her periscope and
circled round at various ranges, viewing the position
cautiously. After forty minutes she broke surface
directly astern, where no gun would bear upon her,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253">253</a></span>
and shelled the <i>Dunraven</i> at a range of a few hundred
yards. Nearly every shot was a hit, but some fell near
the boats. Two burst on the bridge and did much
damage.</p>

<p>In another twenty minutes the enemy ceased firing
and again submerged. Captain Campbell had now no
resource left but his torpedoes, of which he carried two&mdash;one
on each side. He fired the first as the U-boat
steamed past the port side at 150 yards&mdash;too short a
range for certainty of depth. The bubbles passed
just ahead of the periscope, and the enemy failed to
notice it. He turned very sharply round the ship’s
bow and came slowly down the starboard side at three
knots. The second torpedo was then fired, but the
bubbles passed a couple of feet abaft the periscope.
This was cruelly hard luck, for the maximum depth
was on; but there is no doubt that this torpedo, like
the other, must have leaped over, from being fired at
so close a range.</p>

<p>This time the enemy saw his danger, and instantly
submerged. Captain Campbell had now lost his last
chance of a kill, and was bound to signal urgently for
assistance. He did so; but in case the U-boat reappeared
to torpedo or shell again, he arranged for some of his
remaining men to be ready to jump overboard in a
final panic, leaving still himself and one gun’s crew
to fight a forlorn hope. This last extremity was not
reached. The U.S.S. <i>Noma</i> arrived almost immediately
and fired at a periscope a few hundred yards astern
until it disappeared. Then came two King’s ships,
the <i>Attack</i> and <i>Christopher</i>. Boats were recalled,
the fire extinguished, and everything on board having
now exploded, arrangements were made for towing.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254">254</a></span>
For twenty-four hours the <i>Christopher</i> bore her burden
like a saint. Then the weather began to tell upon the
half-dead ship, and sixty of her crew and her wounded
were transferred to the trawler <i>Foss</i>. The next night
the sea claimed the <i>Dunraven</i> in unmistakable tones.
The <i>Christopher</i> came alongside and brought off her
captain and the rest of her crew; and when she rolled
end up, gave her a gunshot and a depth-charge, to take
her to her last berth.</p>

<p>In reporting the action, Captain Campbell brought
specially to notice the extreme bravery of Lieutenant
Bonner and the 4-inch gun’s crew. ‘Lieutenant Bonner
having been blown out of his control by the first explosion,
crawled into the gun-hatch with the crew.
They there remained at their posts with a fire raging
in the poop below, and the deck getting red hot. One
man tore up his shirt to give pieces to the gun’s crew,
to stop the fumes getting into their throats; others
lifted the boxes of cordite off the deck to keep it from
exploding, and all the time they knew that they must
be blown up, as the secondary supply and magazine
were immediately below. They told me afterwards
that communication with the main control was cut off,
and although they knew they would be blown up, they
also knew that they would spoil the show if they moved;
so they remained until actually blown up with their gun.
Then when, as wounded men, they were ordered to remain
quiet in various places during the second action,
they had to lie there unattended and bleeding, with explosions
continually going on aboard, and splinters from
the enemy’s shell-fire penetrating their quarters. Lieutenant
Bonner, himself wounded, did what he could for
two who were with him in the ward-room. When I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255">255</a></span>
visited them after the action, they thought little of
their wounds, but only expressed their disgust that the
enemy had not been sunk. Surely such bravery is hard
to equal.’</p>

<p>Hard to equal&mdash;harder far to speak about! The
King said all that can be said: ‘Greater bravery than
was shown by all officers and men on this occasion
can hardly be conceived.’ And again he testified the
same by symbols&mdash;among them a second bar for Captain
Campbell, V.C., D.S.O., R.N.; the Victoria Cross for
Lieutenant C.&nbsp;G. Bonner, D.S.C., R.N.R.; and another,
under Article 13, for the 4-inch gun’s crew, who named
Ernest Pitcher, P.O., to wear it to the honour of them
all. The whole ship’s company is now starred like
a constellation; but the memory of their service will
long outshine their stars.</p>

<span class="subhead">SUBMARINE <i>v.</i> SUBMARINE</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Since submarines must be hunted, there is something
specially attractive in the idea of setting other submarines
to hunt them; it seems peculiarly just that
while the pirate is lying in wait under water for his
victim, he should himself be ambushed by an avenger
hiding under the same waters and possessed of the same
deadly weapons of offence.</p>

<p>But this method, satisfactory as it is to the imagination,
is involved in several practical difficulties. If
we put ourselves in the position of a submarine commander
with orders to go out and kill U-boats, we shall
quickly come up against some of the more obvious of
these. The sea is a large place; the submarine moves
about it slowly, and therefore takes a long time to patrol
a given area. Also the very worst point of view from
which to survey that area is the eye-piece of a periscope
raised only some two feet above the surface. The
strain upon the eye is very severe, when hour after
hour is spent in looking for ships of ordinary size,
with freeboard, funnels and streamers of smoke. How
much more severe, when the object to be looked for
is a conning-tower at most, with waves tumbling about
it, or possibly only a periscope 4 inches in diameter!</p>

<p>Let us suppose, however, that all the preliminary<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257">257</a></span>
conditions are as good as they can be; that the commander
is in the best of health, with sound nerves and
good instruments, and that he is lucky enough to sight
a chance near the beginning of his cruise, while his
eye is unwearied and his judgment alert. He will
still be hampered by two considerations&mdash;he must make
sure that the boat he is about to attack is an enemy
and not a friend, and he must take the not very
remote risk of being rammed, bombed, or depth-charged
by a British destroyer or a German seaplane, while
his attention is fixed entirely on the chase.</p>

<p>Finally, there are the purely technical difficulties
of the attack. Manœuvring for position is not easy,
even when the enemy is a large and visible ship of war;
it is ten times harder when he is a submerged or nearly
submerged vessel, and not steaming straight ahead,
but cruising about with sudden and erratic changes of
course, as he searches for or sights his intended victims.
And here the nature and habits of the torpedo have also
to be considered. A periscope, or even a conning-tower,
is not a very good object for a distant shot.
On the other hand if the range is too short, say less than
250 yards, the torpedo is very likely to miss. This is
due to the fact that a torpedo requires a certain length
of run before it can settle to its course evenly at the
depth for which it is set. It begins by plunging, then
rises, sometimes even breaks surface, and finally takes
its proper depth, which may be set for anything from
6 to 22 feet. A torpedo fired at a periscope must be
set deep, for the submerged part of the boat will be
15 feet or more below the surface. If it were fired at
so short a distance as 100 or 120 yards it would reach
the target while still on its upward bound, and might<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258">258</a></span>
easily leap clean over the U-boat’s rounded back. At
a still less range, it would probably dive under the enemy
altogether. Moreover, up to a distance of 200 yards&mdash;or
even more&mdash;the explosion of a torpedo is dangerous
to the attacker as well as to the attacked. Water,
being much less elastic than air, conveys the shock of
a blow far more completely; and of course, in such a
case, a submarine vessel, being entirely surrounded by
water, would suffer much more from the concussion
than a ship with only part of its hull below the surface.</p>

<p>If we take account of these obvious difficulties, and
remember that there are others of which we know
nothing, we shall realise that the destruction of a
U-boat by one of our own submarines can only be
accomplished by a combination of skill, courage, and
good fortune. The examples which follow will make
this clear.</p>

<p>Let us take first the case of E.&nbsp;54, Lieutenant-Commander
Robert H.&nbsp;T. Raikes, which shows a record
of two successes within less than four months&mdash;one
obtained with comparative ease, the other with great
difficulty. The first of the two needs no detailed account
or comment. E.&nbsp;54, on passage to her patrol ground,
had the good fortune to sight three U-boats in succession
before she had gone far from her base. At two of
these she fired without getting a hit; but the third
she blew all to pieces, and picked up out of the oil and
debris no less than seven prisoners. Her next adventure
was a much more arduous one. She started in mid-August
on a seven-day cruise, and in the first four
days saw nothing more exciting than a neutral cruiser
carrying out target practice. On the morning of the
fifth day, a U-boat was sighted at last; and after twenty-<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259">259</a></span>five
minutes’ manœuvring, two torpedoes were fired at
her, at a distance of 600 yards, with deflection for 11
knots. Her actual speed turned out to be more nearly
6 or 7 knots, and both shots must have missed ahead
of her. She dived immediately, and a third torpedo
failed to catch her as she went down.</p>

<p>An hour and twenty minutes afterwards she reappeared
on the surface, and Lieut.-Commander Raikes
tried to cut her off, by steering close in to the bank
by which she was evidently intending to pass. E.&nbsp;54
grounded on the bank, and her commander got her
off with feelings that can be easily imagined. Less than
an hour after, a U-boat&mdash;the same or another&mdash;was
sighted coming down the same deep. Again Lieut.-Commander
Raikes tried to cut her off, and again he
grounded in the attempt. He was forced to come to the
surface when the enemy was still 2,000 yards away.
To complete his ill-fortune, another U-boat was sighted
within an hour and a quarter, but got away without
a shot being possible.</p>

<p>Twenty-four hours later the luck turned, and all
these disappointments were forgotten. At 2.6 <span class="smcap smaller">P.M.</span>,
Lieut.-Commander Raikes sighted yet another U-boat
in open water, on the old practice ground of the neutral
cruiser of three days before. He put E.&nbsp;54 to her full
speed, and succeeded in overtaking the enemy. By
2.35 he had placed her in a winning position on the
U-boat’s bow, and at right angles to her course. At
400 yards’ range he fired two torpedoes, and had the
satisfaction to see one of them detonate in a fine cloud
of smoke and spray. When the smoke cleared away,
the U-boat had entirely disappeared; there were no
survivors. Next day, after dark, E.&nbsp;54’s time being<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260">260</a></span>
up, she returned to her base, having had a full taste
of despair and triumph.</p>

<p>Earlier in the year, Lieutenant Bradshaw, in G.&nbsp;13,
had had a somewhat similar experience. He went
out to a distant patrol in cold March weather and had
not been on the ground five hours when his adventures
began. At 11.50 <span class="smcap smaller">A.M.</span> he was blinded by a snow squall;
and when he emerged from it, he immediately sighted
a large hostile submarine within shot. Unfortunately
the U-boat sighted G.&nbsp;13 at the same moment, and the
two dived simultaneously. This, as may easily be
imagined, is one of the most trying of all positions in
the submarine game, and so difficult as to be almost
insoluble. The first of the two adversaries to move
will very probably be the one to fall in the duel; yet
a move must be made sooner or later, and the boldest
will be the first to move. Lieutenant Bradshaw seems
to have done the right thing both ways. For an hour
and a half he lay quiet, listening for any sign of the
U-boat’s intentions; then, at 1.30 <span class="smcap smaller">P.M.</span>, he came to the
surface, prepared for a lightning shot or an instantaneous
manœuvre. No more complete disappointment could
be imagined. He could see no trace of the enemy&mdash;he
had not even the excitement of being shot at. On the
following day he was up early, and spent nearly eleven
fruitless hours knocking about in a sea which grew
heavier and heavier from the S.S.E. Then came another
hour which made ample amends. At 3.55 <span class="smcap smaller">P.M.</span> a large
U-boat came in sight, steering due west. Lieutenant
Bradshaw carried out a rapid dive and brought his
tubes to the ready; courses and speeds as requisite
for attack. (These reports often omit superfluous
details, while they bristle with intention.) The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261">261</a></span>
manœuvring which followed took over half an hour,
and must have seemed interminably long to everyone
in G.&nbsp;13. At 4.30 the enemy made the tension still
greater by altering course some 35°. It was not until
4.49 that Lieutenant Bradshaw found himself exactly
where all commanders would wish to be, 8 points on
the enemy’s bow. He estimated the U-boat’s speed
at eight knots, allowed 18° deflection accordingly, and
fired twice. It was a long shot in rough water, and
he had nearly a minute to wait for the result. Then
came the longed-for sound of a heavy explosion. A
column of water leaped up, directly under the U-boat’s
conning-tower, and she disappeared instantly. Ten
minutes afterwards, G.&nbsp;13 was on the surface, and
making her way through a vast lake of oil, which lay
thickly upon the sea over an area of a mile. In such an
oil lake a swimmer has no margin of buoyancy, and it
was not surprising that there were no survivors to pick
up. The only relics of the U-boat were some pieces
of board from her interior fittings. G.&nbsp;13 completed
her patrol of twenty-eight days, and returned to her
base without sighting another enemy&mdash;she had cleared
that area for a month.</p>

<p>A successful hunt by Lieutenant North, in command
of H.&nbsp;4, resembles G.&nbsp;13’s exploit in many respects,
but has this picturesque difference, that it took place
in southern waters and in a bright May midnight. It
was more than forty-eight hours since H.&nbsp;4 had cast
off from the pens before she sighted the quarry she was
looking for, 3 points on her port bow. The hour was
11.10 <span class="smcap smaller">P.M.</span> and the moon was nearly full. Lieutenant
North at once turned towards the enemy and went to
night action stations. The distance between the two<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262">262</a></span>
boats was about 1,000 yards, and it was desirable to
reduce this to a minimum&mdash;say to 250 yards&mdash;in order
to make sure of a hit in the circumstances. The enemy
was a large U-boat and was going about 8 knots, in a
course which would bring her across H.&nbsp;4 almost too
directly. But she had not advanced more than 300
yards when she altered course 8 points to starboard.
Lieutenant North instantly saw his opportunity,
turned first to port to cut her off; and then, when his
superior speed had made this a certainty, 8 points to
starboard to close her. Within four minutes after
sighting her, he had placed himself on her port beam
at the desired range of 250 yards. He fired two
torpedoes. Both hit and detonated, one under the
conning-tower, and one in the engine-room. The enemy
sank immediately&mdash;in fifteen seconds she had gone
completely. Then came the usual search for survivors,
and two were eventually rescued; they were the captain
of the boat and his quartermaster. H.&nbsp;4 combed out
the surrounding area thoroughly; but no more could
be found; and in view of the presence of prisoners,
Lieutenant North at once returned to his base.</p>

<p>It is not to our purpose to enumerate successful
shots of the simple and easy kind; one or two examples
will stand for a number of these. C.&nbsp;15, for instance,
sighted an enemy submarine at 2.43 on a November
afternoon, dived and flooded tubes; sighted the U-boat
again in the periscope at 3.12; at 3.15 fired at 400 yards.
The noise of the explosion was slight, but the enemy&mdash;U.C.
65&mdash;sank immediately, and C.&nbsp;15 picked up five
survivors. D.&nbsp;7, Commander C.&nbsp;G. Brodie, sank U.&nbsp;45
only twenty-two minutes after sighting her, at a range of
1,200 yards. Lieutenant A.&nbsp;W. Forbes, in C.&nbsp;7, sighted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263">263</a></span>
a large U-boat on his port quarter, at 3.32 <span class="smcap smaller">A.M.</span> of a
dark and misty April night. He immediately attacked
on the surface, and sank her with a single shot at 400
yards. These prompt and successful shots deserve
full credit; but every now and then some exceptional
circumstance will add a special reason for satisfaction.
For example, it is always good to catch a pirate
red-handed. Lieut.-Commander G.&nbsp;R.&nbsp;S. Watkins, in
E.&nbsp;45, was beginning his day’s patrol at 6.15, on a dim
October morning, when he observed flashes on his starboard
bow. He altered course in that direction, and
after five minutes sighted an unhappy merchantman
under fire from a U-boat. He dived at once and approached.
At 6.37, he was near enough to see through
his periscope that the vessel was a steamer with Dutch
colours painted on her side. She was a neutral, and of
course unarmed, but such considerations meant nothing
to the U-boat pirate, who had ceased fire and was coolly
waiting for his victim to sink. He was a large submarine,
partially submerged, and by way of further
caution he was steering about in figures of 8, with his
gun still manned. But, for all his caution, just retribution
was upon him. Lieut.-Commander Watkins fired
his first shot at 400 yards, and missed&mdash;altered course
instantly, and in little more than three minutes fired
again, from a new angle, two shots in rapid succession.
Thirty seconds afterwards, justice was done in full; a
loud explosion was heard and there was a tremendous
convulsion in the water. For the moment, E.&nbsp;45 was
blinded&mdash;her periscope was submerged. With a rebound
she came to the surface, saw in one quick glance
that her enemy was destroyed, and sank again to 60
feet. When she had reloaded, and returned finally<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264">264</a></span>
to the surface, both pirate and Dutchman had disappeared
into the depths.</p>

  <img src="images/i_265.jpg" width="448" height="450" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">‘Was steering about in figures of 8, with his gun still manned.’</div></div>

<p>Lieut.-Commander Vincent M. Cooper, in E.&nbsp;43, also
had the satisfaction of surprising an enemy at work.
This was a U.C. boat, engaged not in actually firing
on merchantmen, but in the still more deadly and
murderous business of laying mines for them. When
sighted by E.&nbsp;43, she had evidently just come to the
surface, as men were observed on the bridge engaged
in spreading the bridge screen. Lieut.-Commander
Cooper went straight for her at full speed. But as it
was 9.30 <span class="smcap smaller">A.M.</span>, and broad daylight, he was forced to
remain submerged, and being in shallow water he soon
had to slow down. Again and again he bumped heavily
on shoals, but fortunately was never quite forced to
the surface. After an hour of this he got into deeper
water, and was able to go faster. At 11.0 he rose to
24 feet, and took a sight through the periscope. There
was the enemy, about 400 yards away on his port beam.
He dived, and five minutes later came up for another
sight. This time the U-boat was on his port quarter.
He turned towards her, but at the moment of attack,
when the sights were just coming on, E.&nbsp;43 dipped under
a big wave and the chance was spoiled.</p>

<p>Her commander was not to be thrown off; he
immediately increased to full speed, altered course,
and planned a fresh attack. By 11.17&mdash;nearly two
hours after beginning the chase&mdash;he was in position,
2 points abaft the enemy’s beam at 550 yards’ distance.
This time he took every precaution to ensure a kill.
On firing he dipped his periscope, so that in case the
boat rose suddenly nothing should be visible; and at
the same time he yawed to starboard, so as to be ready<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265">265</a><a class="hidev" id="Page_266">266</a></span>
with another tube if the first shot was a miss. Then
came a trying period of suspense and disappointment;
he listened in vain for the sound of an explosion, and
after forty-five seconds raised his periscope to see what
had happened. It was only later, on communicating
with his officers and men in the forward and after
compartments, that he found, as others have found,
how differently sound may affect the different parts
of a submarine when submerged. The central compartment
may be completely deafened, either by reason
of its position, when a detonation occurs directly ahead
or astern, or by the much slighter continuous noises
of the various electrical machines which are situated
there. In this case, the dull report of the under-water
explosion, which was not audible to Lieut.-Commander
Cooper, was heard in both the other compartments
about twenty seconds after he had fired the torpedo.</p>

<p>At the moment when the periscope was raised, the
U-boat had disappeared, and there was a great commotion
in the water where she had been. E.&nbsp;43 hurried
to the spot and found the surface covered with a black
oily substance which stuck to the glass of the periscope
and put it out of action. Lieut.-Commander Cooper
rose to 20 feet and put up his second periscope, but
the U-boat was gone and had left no survivors.</p>

<p>E.&nbsp;35 has a chase to her credit, in some respects
very similar to this one; but the story is worth adding,
because of the masterly precision with which the Commander,
Lieutenant D’Oyly Hughes, conducted the
manœuvre and reported it afterwards. At 4 o’clock,
on a May afternoon, he sighted in the periscope a low-lying
object two to three miles distant on the port
beam. His own boat was at 26 feet, and the object was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267">267</a></span>
only visible intermittently, when on top of a wave&mdash;it
was impossible to be certain about it. He turned at
once and went straight for it, speeding up as he did so.
But this led to immediate difficulties. There was a
long breaking swell across his course and a strong wind.
Depth keeping was almost impossible, and there was a
constant risk of E.&nbsp;35 breaking surface and throwing
away her chance. It was necessary to go down to
quieter levels, and for some time she travelled at 40
feet with full speed on.</p>

<p>At 4.18, Lieutenant D’Oyly Hughes reduced speed
and brought her up again to 26 feet. His first observation,
on looking into the periscope, was that the bearing
had changed; and secondly, that the floating object
was without doubt a large enemy submarine. He
headed at once to cut her off&mdash;she was making slowly
off northwards&mdash;and dived to 40 feet in order to increase
to full speed himself.</p>

<p>After a twenty-four minutes’ run he slowed down
again for periscope observation, ordering the boat to be
brought to 23 feet. This was a very anxious moment,
for the sea once more all but gave him away. The
swell rolled E.&nbsp;35 up till she was actually for an instant
breaking surface, within 1,800 yards of the enemy. She
was got down again to 26 feet without having been seen,
and her commander then very skilfully placed her in
the trough of the sea, where he could pursue the chase
on a slightly converging course instead of following
right astern. On this course, which soon became absolutely
parallel to that of the enemy, he remained at
periscope depth for another half hour; then at 5.20,
observing that he was not gaining fast enough, he
dived again to 40 feet and speeded up, at the same<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268">268</a></span>
time bringing a torpedo-tube to the ‘ready.’ At 5.35
he slowed once more for observation, and found the
range had decreased to 1,100 yards. Down he went
again for another spurt. At 5.53, he was within 900
yards; but as the parallel courses of the two boats
were only a little more than 100 yards apart, he was
‘still very fine on enemy’s port quarter’&mdash;the shot was
almost a bow-chaser shot and practically hopeless.
He dived again, and for twenty-four more minutes
patiently continued to observe and spurt alternately.</p>

<p>At 6.17, a dramatic change occurred in the situation.
On rising to observe, he found that the enemy, for some
irrelevant reason of her own, had turned 16 points to
starboard, and was now actually coming back on a
course which would bring her down the starboard side
of E.&nbsp;35 at a distance of scarcely more than 200 yards.
This was much too close for a desirable shot&mdash;setting
aside the dangers of the explosion, it was not certain
that the torpedo would have picked up its depth
correctly in so short a run, and a miss might put the
U-boat on guard. Still, to manœuvre for a fresh
position would take time and the chance was quite a
possible one; the torpedo, at the end of 200 yards,
would be at any rate near picking up its depth, and
might well make a detonating hit on its upward track&mdash;it
could not miss for deflection at that range; the
enemy’s length was taking up almost the whole width
of the periscope. Even if it were a miss underneath,
it would probably escape notice, especially in so heavy
a sea.</p>

<p>Lieutenant D’Oyly Hughes took exactly one minute
to perceive the change of course and the wholly altered
situation, to weigh all the above considerations, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269">269</a></span>
to make his decision. At 6.18 he fired, lowered his
periscope, put his helm hard a-starboard, and increased
his speed. The hydrophone operator heard the torpedo
running on her track, but the sound grew fainter and
fainter and died away without a detonation. The shot
was a miss beneath the target; after more than two
long hours, the chase had failed.</p>

<p>The failure was brilliantly redeemed, and with
astonishing swiftness. To realise the swiftness and
the brilliancy of the manœuvre which followed, it is
necessary to bring it vividly before the mind’s eye.
The two boats must be seen at the moment of the first
shot, passing one another at 200 yards on opposite
courses, E.&nbsp;35 going N.E., and the U-boat S.W. on her
starboard beam. At 6.19 the enemy turned a little
more towards E.&nbsp;35, and began to steer due west under
her stern, happily still without sighting her periscope.
E.&nbsp;35 was on her old course, running farther and farther
away to the N.E., and there was already some 500 yards
between them. But when the U-boat took up her
westerly course, Lieutenant D’Oyly Hughes in an
instant sent his boat on a swift curve to port, turning
in quick succession N., N.W., W., and S.W., till in less
than seven minutes after missing his first shot he was
bearing down S.S.W. on the enemy, and therefore only
30 degrees abaft her starboard beam and hardly more
than 500 yards distant. By pure luck, the unconscious
U-boat had at the first critical moment done precisely
the right thing to save herself; by sheer skill, the
E-boat had been brought back to a winning position.
At 6.25 Lieutenant D’Oyly Hughes&mdash;coolly estimating
speed, distance, and deflection&mdash;fired one torpedo at his
huge enemy’s fore-turret and another at her after-turret.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270">270</a></span>
Both hit where they were aimed to hit. The first
made very little noise, but threw up a large column of
water and debris. The second did not appear to the
eye to produce quite so good a burst; but the noise was
louder, and the concussion felt in E.&nbsp;35 was very powerful
indeed, the whole boat shaking and a few lights
going out momentarily. When the smoke and water
column had cleared away, there was nothing to be seen
but a quickly expanding calm area, like a wide lake of
oil with wreckage floating in it, and three or four
survivors clinging to some woodwork. E.&nbsp;35, with her
sub-lieutenant, her coxswain, and one able seaman on
deck, and life-lines ready, went at once to their rescue;
but a second U-boat made her appearance at that
moment, and Lieutenant D’Oyly Hughes was obliged
to dive at once. Three minutes afterwards, a torpedo
passed him on the starboard side; but the new enemy
was over two miles away, and though he reloaded his
tubes and patrolled submerged on various courses, he
never succeeded in picking her up in the periscope.
She, also, had no doubt dived, and the two boats had
scarcely more chance of coming to action than two
men miles apart upon the Downs at midnight.</p>

<p>In such a case, only a lucky chance could bring the
duellists together; and even then successful shooting
would be difficult. But a bold submarine commander,
having once closed, would improvise a new form of
attack rather than let a pirate go his way. E.&nbsp;50 was
commanded by an officer of this temper when she
sighted an enemy submarine, during a patrol off the
east coast. Both boats were submerged at the time;
but they recognised each other’s nationality by the
different appearance of their periscopes. The German<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271">271</a></span>
had two&mdash;thin ones of a light-grey colour, and with an
arched window at the top, peculiar to their Service.
The British commander drove straight at the enemy
at full speed, and reached her before she had time to
get down to a depth of complete invisibility. E.&nbsp;50
struck fair between the periscopes; her stem cut through
the plates of the U-boat’s shell and remained embedded
in her back. Then came a terrific fight, like the death
grapple of two primeval monsters. The German’s
only chance, in his wounded condition, was to come to
the surface before he was drowned by leakage; he blew
his ballast tanks and struggled almost to the surface,
bringing E.&nbsp;50 up with him. The English boat countered
by flooding her main ballast tanks, and weighing her
enemy down into the deep. This put the U-boat to the
desperate necessity of freeing herself, leak or no leak.
For a minute and a half she drew slowly aft, bumping
E.&nbsp;50’s sides as she did so; then her effort seemed to
cease, and her periscopes and conning-towers showed
on E.&nbsp;50’s quarter. She was evidently filling fast;
she had a list to starboard and was heavily down by
the bows. As she sank, E.&nbsp;50 took breath and looked
to her own condition. She was apparently uninjured,
but she had negative buoyancy and her forward hydroplanes
were jammed, so that it was a matter of great
difficulty to get her to rise. After four strenuous
minutes she was brought to the surface, and traversed
the position, searching for any further sign of the U-boat
or her crew. But nothing was seen beyond the
inevitable lake of oil, pouring up like the thick rank
life-blood of the dead sea-monster.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE HUNTED</span></h2>
</div>

<p>The hunter knows little, and cares little, about the feelings
of the hunted; and if he is hunting for food, or to
exterminate vermin, his indifference is not unreasonable.
The submarine may be classed with savage beasts, and
is even less deserving of pity; but it is not actually
an animal, and the difference is important. It is
controlled by beings with human intelligence, speech,
nerves and faculties; and since they are our enemies,
seeking our destruction while we seek theirs, it must
be of interest to us, and may be of advantage, to know
what are their feelings during the chase.</p>

<p>Information of this kind is not easy to obtain; but
the enemy have thought fit to publish, for their own
people, a certain number of accounts by submarine
officers, and they have not been able to prevent all
of them from finding their way to this country. Here,
for instance, is an extract from the ‘War Diary of
U.&nbsp;202,’ by Lieut.-Commander Freiherr Spiegel von
und zu Peckelsheim.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>‘At 4 o’clock I again came up to have a look through
the periscope.... On our starboard bow was a large
French torpedo-boat with 4 funnels, on the watch.
There was no land in sight.</p>

<p>‘I should much have liked to sink the smart-looking<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_273">273</a></span>
Frenchman. But the considerable probability, that
in such a position I should then have the whole pack
hunting me, induced me to refrain. I must admit that
I found it very hard not to utilise this opportunity for
a shot, and very reluctantly I lowered the periscope and
gave orders to dive. This was our salvation. If we
had continued a few minutes longer at the level at which
here one uses the periscope, I should not be sitting
to-day smoking cigarettes and writing my experiences.</p>

<p>‘We were still diving, and the depth-gauge showed
17 metres (56 feet). Suddenly we all had the sensation
of having been struck on the head with a hammer.
For a second we lost consciousness; then we picked
ourselves up from the deck, or from the corners into
which we had been thrown, feeling pains in our heads,
shoulders, and other parts of our bodies. The whole
boat throbbed and trembled. Were we still alive?
What had happened? Why was it so dark, black as
night? Ah! the light was out!</p>

<p>‘“Examine the fuse!”</p>

<p>‘“Fuse gone!”</p>

<p>‘“Put in spare fuse!”</p>

<p>‘Suddenly we had light again. This was all a
matter of seconds, happening in far less time than it
takes to describe it.</p>

<p>‘What had happened? Was it really not the end
of us? Was not the water rushing into the boat somewhere,
and carrying us down to the bottom? It must
have been a mine&mdash;a tremendous mine detonation close
to the boat. Reports were made automatically from
all compartments. “Bow compartment not making
water; stern compartment all right; engine-room no
water.” No water anywhere!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274">274</a></span>
‘Then the boat inclined itself at a peculiar angle&mdash;the
bow went down and the stern rose up. The boat
was unaccountably trimmed by the bow, although the
hydroplanes were hard over in the opposite direction.</p>

<p>‘“There is something wrong, sir,” reported the man
at the diving-wheel. “The boat won’t answer to her
helm. We must be hung up somewhere, by a rope, or
perhaps a net!”</p>

<p>‘The devil! We are in a net, of course, and above
us there are mines secured to the net. It is enough
to drive one out of one’s mind.</p>

<p>‘“Pay attention!” I shouted from the conning-tower.
“We have got to get through! Hydroplanes
hard up and hard down, utmost speed ahead with both
engines! Don’t let her rise! Whatever happens,
keep down! There are mines above us!”</p>

<p>‘The engines started, revolving at their highest
revolutions. The boat shot forward, caught in the net,
strained against it, bored itself a way downwards, tugged,
tore, and finally left the wire net all ripped apart.</p>

<p>‘“Hurrah! We are free! The boat answers to her
helm!” cried the helmsman from below.</p>

<p>‘“Go deeper, dive to 50 metres (164 feet),” I ordered.
“This is an evil spot hereabouts&mdash;it is hell itself.”</p>

<p>‘I sat down on the life-saving apparatus and buried
my head in my hands. Everything was going round
with me like a mill-wheel. Above my eyes I had a
pain as though needles were sticking into my forehead,
and I had such a humming in my ears that I stopped
them up with my fingers.</p>

<p>‘“This is certainly an evil spot,” I repeated to myself,
“but what luck we had, most extraordinary luck,
which has saved us!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_275">275</a></span>
‘Some time elapsed before the pains in my head
allowed me to fit things together and understand what
had happened. Yes, it was pure luck that we had dived
just in time. We were at a depth of 17 metres when the
explosion occurred, our bows touching the net. Things
grew clearer and clearer to me as I thought them
over.</p>

<p>‘When we hit against the net we stretched it taut
and thus actuated the mine detonators, the mines being
attached to the net at the depth at which a submarine
usually proceeds. If we had attempted to attack the
torpedo-boat, or for any other reasons had remained a
little longer at the depth at which the periscope can be
used, we should have run into the net in just the way that
the enemy would have wished&mdash;viz., so that the mines
would have exploded alongside or underneath us.
What actually happened was that the mine exploded
above us, and the main force was expended in the line of
least resistance (viz., upwards), and we suffered nothing
more than a fearful fright, and perhaps a few disfigurements
to the thin plating of the superstructure.’</p></blockquote>

<p>U.&nbsp;202 was certainly lucky this time. And though
she was saved by sheer luck and nothing else, it is not
unnatural, considering the ever-growing roll of those
which fail to escape, that Lieut.-Commander Freiherr
Spiegel von und zu Peckelsheim should enlarge upon
his terror at the moment and his self-congratulation
afterwards. But he is mistaken if he thinks that he
has come through the worst that can happen to a
submarine commander. His struggle in the net was
short and easy, when compared with the feats of a
Bruce or a Cochrane in passing and repassing the barrage<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276">276</a></span>
off Kilid Bahr; and the jar he got from his mine seems
to have affected his head more than his boat. In older
navies, and among less excitable nations, these things
are reported more quietly&mdash;more from a professional
than a sensational point of view. ‘I think,’ writes
Commander Courtney Boyle of a very similar accident,
‘I must have caught the moorings of a mine with my
tail as I was turning, and exploded it ... the whole
boat was very badly shaken.’ Not a word more about
it, though his cruise continued for more than ten days
afterwards. Without disparaging the German officer
(who no doubt shares the national temperament, and
knows how to move his audience), we may take pleasure
in noting that the steadiness of nerve and the scientific
view are in our favour. Given anything like a fair
fight, and a reasonable time for play, it will not be
the Peckelsheims who will win against our men.</p>

<p>An experience of another kind is described in a
number of the <cite>Illustrierte Zeitung</cite> of July 12, 1917.
The date of the engagement was February 22, in the
same year.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>‘Just at dinner time the watch reports a tank
steamer in an E.N.E. direction, steering a course
approximately towards the boat. Masts, bridge and
funnel are visible above the horizon. Tank steamers
are very hard to sink, as they have stray bulkheads
fitted to keep their volatile cargo in check. The torpedo
must hit the aftermost engine to stop the tank steamer.
The periscope must only be shown occasionally for a
very short time, so as not to alarm her. The torpedo
is fired at 700 metres (765 yards) away, the submarine
comes to the surface and fires a shot from her forward<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277">277</a></span>
gun, as a signal to stop. The steamer understands,
lowers two boats, and the crew abandon ship. Steam
is blown off in a high white column. The master
appears to be a sensible man, who does not intend to
expose himself to shell fire for no purpose. The submarine
approaches submerged and takes stock of the
vessel&mdash;a black tank steamer, grey superstructure,
no guns&mdash;the naval patent log hanging over the stern.
The submarine then makes for the boats. As soon as
they see her periscope, they hastily pull away. At
length the submarine finds a favourable position to
come to the surface, outside the boats, so that the latter
are in the line of fire. She rises to the surface, with
compressed air in her midship diving-tanks, the conning-tower
hatch is opened and the process of blowing out
the tanks begins. The boats have pulled away a little
further, and just as they are being hailed there is a
flash from the steamer.</p>

<p>‘A submarine trap! Alarm. Flood tanks, dive
rapidly! The seconds seem interminable. The superstructure
abaft the conning-tower is penetrated, and
hardly has the hatch been closed when there is a sharp
report in the conning-tower, a yellow flash, and explosive
gases fill the air. A shell has penetrated the side of the
conning-tower and exploded inside. All the fittings
are shattered by splinters; there is a sound of breaking
glass. Another shell will fall directly and that will be
the end of the war for us. Water is splashing in through
the shot hole; the boat is sinking into the shelter of
the deep. The conning-tower is cleared, the inner
hatch and voice-pipe cock are closed, and the leads laid
into the control room.</p>

<p>‘“Anyone injured in the conning-tower?” Only one,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278">278</a></span>
very slightly; but their faces are black and their clothes
look as though they had seen service.</p>

<p>‘At 20 metres (65 feet) there are two sharp explosions,
and the boat trembles. The “poor shipwrecked
men” have thrown depth-charges after us. A few of
the lights go out, and further damage to the main
switchboard is averted by timely action. The conning-tower
is filling. In theory the boat can still remain
afloat, but no one has yet survived to tell us how. The
increasing weight causes the boat to sink to 40 metres
(131 feet) in spite of her being down by the stern and
with the engines at utmost speed. Water spurts through
the leaky places, and, owing to short circuits, half the
lights and important machinery break down successively&mdash;gyro
compass, main rudder, forward hydroplane
(which, to make matters worse, jams at ‘hard
down’), trimming pumps, and all control apparatus.
The tricolour captured from the full-rigged ship <i>La
Bayonne</i> is pressed into service to plug the leak. The
boat must be lightened by compressed air in the after
and amidship diving tanks, and brought on to an even
keel. She rises, certainly, but is more down by the
stern than ever. The after compressed air service
breaks down. We must avoid coming to the surface,
whatever happens, for up above the enemy is lying
in wait to fire at us. At 20 metres (65 feet) the diving-tank
valves are opened, and all available men sent
forward, in order that their weight may cause the bow
to sink. The boat sinks by the bow, and the manœuvre
is repeated. In another twenty minutes it becomes
impossible to proceed submerged. There is now only
one, not very promising, alternative&mdash;to come to the
surface suddenly and run away, firing as we go.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279">279</a></span>
‘“Compressed air in all the tanks, open galley ventilator,
man the guns, Diesel engines ready, and put to
utmost speed as soon as possible.”</p>

<p>‘The boat comes to the surface, the galley hatch is
opened. A torrent of water rushes down; never mind,
we shall have to swim for it directly, anyhow. Now
the way is clear to the surface. The steamer is about
25 hms. (2734 yards) away, and firing as fast as she can.
“You haven’t got us yet&mdash;not by a long way!” The
guns quickly reply. Any result? The telescopic sights
are still in the flooded conning-tower. The M.A.N.
motors are quickly started&mdash;much more quickly than
is permissible, but when all is staked on one card there
is no help for it. All the men who are not occupied
below are bringing up supply ammunition. The sub-lieutenant
suddenly feels his feet blown away from
under him, and staggers through a cloud of smoke
against the gun. Poor fellow, he has probably had
both legs shot away. But no, only a few small splinters&mdash;nothing
more! The shell passed between the legs
of the foremost gunlayer, the drum of his ear was
perforated by the report, and there are some lumps
and holes in the ready ammunition. The shells pass
through, close to the men; they look like black specks
in the air just before they fall. One of the railing
supports is shattered. A Leipzig man is standing in
the stern at the hand-wheel, steering calmly by the
verbal directions of the navigating warrant-officer&mdash;the
compasses can no longer be used.</p>

<p>‘The telescopic sights can now be recovered from
the conning-tower. There is a report, “Destroyer to
starboard.” Quite right. She is proceeding on a
parallel course at 80 hms. (8750 yards) and the fire of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280">280</a></span>
her four guns mingles with that of the tank steamer. A
destroyer like that has a speed of over 30 knots, and
carries 4-inch guns.</p>

<p>‘“On lifebelts!” Below the horizon, in a S.S.E.
direction, there must be a sailing-vessel; we sighted one
this morning. Perhaps the boat may be able to reach
her, so as to save the crew from a <i>Baralong</i> fate.</p>

<p>‘The guns’ crews have become so deaf from the noise
of their own guns that it is only possible to direct one
gun by verbal orders. The decoy ship is now so far
away that there is no further need to fire at her. Open
fire on the new foe then! This is not a destroyer, however,
but a “submarine-destroyer” of the <i>Foxglove</i>
class, about twice the size of the submarine, but no
faster. At the same moment the second-engineer
reports that he can repair the damaged conning-tower,
and our hopes soar as far as neutral Spain.</p>

<p>‘“Open fire at 70 hms. (7655 yards)!” Soon the
columns of water from the shells, as high as the funnels,
mark the fall of the shots, and the enemy begins to
zigzag to avoid the troublesome shells, thereby interfering
with the aim of her own guns. Suddenly the
superstructure is enveloped in black smoke. A hit!
Another! Several shells do not throw up a column of
water; they must have buried themselves in her hull.
Now she turns away, escapes from the zone of fire,
and then follows in our wake.</p>

<p>‘The damage caused by the short circuit is repaired,
ammunition put ready beside the guns, and, like Wellington
at Waterloo, we await the coming of night. Our
pursuer must have reported the engagement by wireless,
with position and course. Soon destroyers will appear
and compel the submarine to submerge. The leaking<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281">281</a></span>
oil supply will leave a track of oil on the surface, and
indicate where depth-charges should be dropped.</p>

<p>‘The wireless aerial, which has been shot away, is
repaired in order to keep an eye on the enemy’s signals.
Nothing to be heard. A lucky shot must have destroyed
our pursuer’s wireless, and she cannot report. All the
men who are not occupied below are on deck smoking,
discussing their impressions, experiences, and premonitions;
dreams, uncomfortable forebodings, fortune-telling
from cards, and all the means&mdash;such as green
frogs&mdash;by which old fortune-tellers and ancient augurs
used to foretell the future.</p>

<p>‘The sun is sinking below the horizon; the chase
has already lasted more than three hours. The decoy
ship has long passed out of sight, and no new enemies
have appeared. Suddenly shells begin falling close
by. The <i>Foxglove</i> means to have another try as
long as the light holds, and we feel that this is an
impertinence. “Man the guns!”</p>

<p>‘Again the after gun carries off the honours of the
engagement. The rounds follow close on one another:
sometimes three shells are in the air at once. They
will soon reach their target; the enemy again tries
to zigzag. Range and deflection are quickly adjusted,
and the shells leave her no peace. Once again that
beautiful cloud of black smoke envelopes her superstructure
and several others fail to raise the expected
column of water. The enemy has ceased firing; she
turns sharply away at 92 hms. (10,000 yards), and follows
us only at a respectful distance. An hour later she
disappears in the darkness.’</p></blockquote>

<p>The deliberately false German <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">communiqués</i>, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282">282</a></span>
even the more craftily composed stories in their press,
are, as a rule, distinguished only for their clumsiness
and bad psychology. But this is a vivid and quite
possible account, and, if the details are accurate, the
commander of the submarine had a most trying experience
and brought his boat home by great luck.
It is hard to imagine a moment more desperate than
that in which, after struggling to the surface and escaping
from the Q-boat’s guns, he heard the report of ‘Destroyer
to starboard,’ and knew that he could neither dive nor
run from such an enemy. A good deal might have
been made of this by a more inventive writer;
the simple comment ‘Quite right!’ is much more convincing
than any highly coloured phrase, and is almost
enough by itself to prove the narrative genuine. Another
intense moment lightly touched is that in which the
deadly ‘destroyer’ turns out to be only the little
10-knot patrol boat <i>Alyssum</i>, with her small guns, and a
flight for bare life becomes suddenly a successful repulse
of the enemy. It is noticeable, too, that the commander
is not once mentioned, and all his orders are given as
uttered rather than as heard; the narrator, moreover,
is familiar with the story of Wellington at Waterloo,
and makes a country gentleman’s joke about missing
a hare. On the whole, I think it is plain that we have
here a true account.</p>

<p>Stories such as this are hard to come by, for the
hunted seldom escape so narrowly and with so good
a tale to tell. But our own records show at least one
case of the kind, and it is one in which the crew of the
submarine passed through an even severer trial, for
they were hunted by their own side and had not the
joy of a good fighting chance to sustain them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_283">283</a></span>
In August, 1917, Lieut.-Commander V.&nbsp;M. Cooper,
in command of one of H.M. submarines, was ordered
to patrol a neighbouring coast, close in, between certain
parallels. He was warned not to arrive on his billet
before 10 <span class="smcap smaller">A.M.</span>, for the very good reason that some of our
own light forces were conducting operations in that
direction during the night, and might be met returning
at any time in the early morning. It must be
remembered that when such a meeting does occur, no
system of signalling is to be relied on for safety. A
submarine will always be attacked on sight by any
ship, friend or enemy, for she is a danger too deadly
to be given a moment’s chance. Her colours, if she
show any, may be false, and only a seaplane can afford
her the time necessary for answering a private signal.
Commander Cooper knew all about this. He decided
to arrive on his billet about noon, when the risk would
presumably be over.</p>

<p>At 8 o’clock, then, on the finest summer morning of
the year, Commander Cooper was making his passage
at normal surface speed, when the horizon on his
starboard bow began to be delicately shaded by faint
pencilled lines. Ten minutes more and a number of
ships were visible, two points on the bow, and five to
six miles away. They were immediately in the sun,
and blurred by the haze, so that it was impossible to
detect their nationality. They might be our own squadron,
coming back unexpectedly early, or more likely
a hostile force running from them. The only thing
certain was that they had sighted the submarine and
were bent on her destruction, for they were all bows on,
bearing down upon her at high speed&mdash;destroyers and
cruisers&mdash;throwing up clouds of dense black smoke.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_284">284</a></span>
Commander Cooper was in no indecent hurry, but
he knew what he had to do. He must get down, or be
put down. Moreover, he must get well down; for the
water was very clear, and the sea flat calm, without a
ripple. After a last look at the charging squadron he
dived to ninety feet, changing his course to 185°.</p>

<p>His troubles began at once: the helm was reported
jammed&mdash;it was amidships. He sent the first-lieutenant
to inspect, the report was that the gear was
all correct&mdash;the jamming seemed to be due to the
tightening of the rudder-post gland, either from external
pressure, or from some distortion of the after compartment
of the ship. In any case, nothing could be
done for the moment, and there were plenty of distractions
coming. At 8.37 the sound of propellers
was recorded on the hydrophone&mdash;the destroyers were
passing from port to starboard overhead, like hounds
abreast trying to pick up a scent.</p>

<p>One of them, must have thought she had hit it off,
for a tremendous explosion shook the submarine&mdash;a
depth-charge had been dropped not far behind her,
shaking her stern violently. In her steering flat, the
first-lieutenant and his men were lifted bodily off
their feet. The commander continued his dive, and
to his great comfort took bottom at 125 feet on the
gauge.</p>

<p>Within three minutes of the first explosion, a second
one followed. It was equally violent, and to Commander
Cooper appeared even louder; but he told himself
that this effect was probably due to the relative position
of the bomb, which had apparently detonated in a
line with the conning-tower. As he was himself in the
control-room, in the centre of the ship, the explosion<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_285">285</a></span>
would naturally sound louder, being on the starboard
beam instead of aft.</p>

<p>The boat was well built, and the commander had
perfect confidence in her. This was not his first experience
of the kind. Exactly a year before, he had been out in
the Cattegat in an E-boat and had met ‘a wrong un’&mdash;a
<i>Greif</i> or <i>Möwe</i>, which had opened fire on him with
four 6-inch guns at 2000 yards and straddled him at
once. The boat had to dive as she was, in complete
surface trim. Shot after shot fell close to her; she was
shaken by explosives and struck by splinters. Finally
a 6-inch shell came alongside and threw up a huge
column of water which fell plump on the commander
as he descended through the hatch. Part of it accompanied
him down the ladder, but he had the presence
of mind to draw the lid down behind him, and he and
his boat lived to tell the tale. So he knew that a
British submarine can stand a shock or two. But what
made him really anxious was the question&mdash;which he
hoped would occur to no one else on board&mdash;why did
those two depth-charges fall so near one another: why
did the enemy drop the second so close to the first? The
horrible suspicion came into his mind that his position
was being given away by something that he could only
guess at&mdash;some noise or some escape of air bubbles or
oil which was reaching the surface.</p>

  <img src="images/i_287.jpg" width="409" height="600" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">‘A huge column of water which fell plump on the commander.’</div></div>

<p>What was to be done? Nothing, but to lie closer
than ever, and enjoy the calm of the man who has done
all that is possible. The order was given to stop all
motors, even the Sperry motor for running the gyro
compass. All vent valves, and other possible leaking
places, were inspected and reported tight.</p>

<p>Then came the third explosion, the most violent of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_286">286</a></span>
all. Lights went out suddenly, and the crew&mdash;groping
in darkness&mdash;thought that the end had come.</p>

<p>For a moment the ship seemed to be stunned; then
the lights reappeared. They had not been injured,
but the shock had thrown all the chopper-switches
on the auxiliary switchboard to the ‘Off’ position.
Not a trace of a leak could be discovered&mdash;the ship
was alive still, and without a mortal wound. In her
commander’s judgment it would take a direct hit, or
something very near it, to kill her.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most trying time of all was that which
now followed. What happened? Nothing happened.
It was that which was so trying. From 9.5 <span class="smcap smaller">A.M.</span>, when
the third depth-charge exploded, till 4.7 <span class="smcap smaller">P.M.</span>, the submarine
lay motionless on the sea-bed; no one on board
knew when it would be safe to move, or even whether
it would be possible at all&mdash;for both helm and hydroplanes
were jammed and other defects might be discovered.
This was a test of moral stability as severe as
any yet recorded, even in the submarine service, and
it is not surprising that Commander Cooper was eventually
ordered to add to his report a special statement
on the moral effects of the strain upon his ship’s company.
He reported accordingly, not in the picturesque style
of the German officer, exhilarated by his successful
fight, but with the brevity of a man of science and
the simplicity of a narrator who has nothing to prove.
The behaviour of the officers he assumes without a word;
that of the men, he says, was admirable. Naturally it
varied with the individual; the older and more experienced
men observed the demeanour of their officers,
and were content to abide by it; the younger ones
showed more difference, each in accordance with his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_287">287</a><a class="hidev" id="Page_288">288</a></span>
temperament; but they, too, did excellently, and having
been assured that all was well, the whole company
settled down to read or to occupy themselves in other
ways. In the majority of cases the events of the day
had no permanent effect, though for a short time afterwards
some of the men would start on being wakened
or touched suddenly by others. As to himself, the
commander declares that he thought the chances of
being destroyed by depth-charges small. To retain
this opinion in the circumstances was a proof of
remarkable constancy; the constancy of the ‘man
convinced against his will’ in the proverb. And he
felt at the time, as he frankly says, that he would much
rather remain on the surface and engage an enemy,
however large, and at all costs, than endure the strain
of a further experience of the kind. It would be likely,
he thought, to affect the judgment for some days,
causing a tendency to act over-cautiously or over-rashly.</p>

<p>None the less he carried on. At 4.7 the submarine
left the bottom and rose to a depth of 28 feet; at 8.35
in the evening she came to the surface and proceeded
to her billet. There she carried out the duties of her
patrol, and six days later, ‘at 1 <span class="smcap smaller">P.M.</span>, British Summer
Time,’ she returned to her base.</p>

<p>Of the hunted who do not return to their base we
cannot hope to hear much. But there was a smart engagement
towards the end of 1917 between an American
convoy-escort and a German submarine, of which
accounts have been given by both sides, those above
water and those below. The convoy was approaching
our shores towards dusk of a November afternoon when
the attack was made. The U-boat’s periscope&mdash;a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_289">289</a></span>
‘finger’ one, of only two inches diameter&mdash;was sighted
by the U.S.S. (destroyer) <i>Fanning</i>, which was at the
moment turning to port at a speed of about fifteen
knots. The submarine was 3 points on the <i>Fanning’s</i>
port bow, distant about 400 yards, and going some
two knots. The other destroyers had just passed
the spot where she was seen; the second of these,
U.S.S. <i>Nicholson</i>, was now on the <i>Fanning’s</i> starboard
bow, and very handy for what was to follow. The
commander of the <i>Fanning</i>, in order to continue his
swing to port, put his helm hard over and at the same
time increased speed to full. The periscope, of course,
disappeared instantly. But every eye on the <i>Fanning</i>
had marked her position. The commander, when he
had turned about 30°, ported his helm so as to bring
his ship right over the desired place, slightly ahead of
the periscope’s last position, and there he dropped a
depth-charge, within three minutes of the first alarm.
It was a fine piece of work, and, as it turned out, a
decisive stroke.</p>

<p>Nothing was seen for the moment, beyond the
upheaval of water caused by the detonation. The
<i>Fanning</i> continued to turn under starboard helm;
the <i>Nicholson</i> altered course to starboard, turned, and
headed for the spot where the charge had been dropped,
intending, no doubt, to drop a shot of her own in the
same place. She could not have made a luckier move.
The conning-tower of the submarine suddenly broke
surface between her and the convoy, about 500 yards
from where it had disappeared. The boat was one of
the new large-type U-boats, and was evidently hit, for
she could neither submerge properly nor keep an even
keel, but went rolling up and down like a gigantic<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_290">290</a></span>
porpoise in the direction of the convoy. The two
destroyers headed for her at full speed; <i>Nicholson</i>,
who was, of course, leading, passed over her, dropped
her depth-charge, and turned to port, firing three rounds
from her stern gun into the wash. Once more the
enemy’s bow came up with a bound. This time he
made a desperate effort to keep on the surface, and
struggled along at two knots, being about 30° down by
the stern. Finally he righted himself, no doubt by
filling tanks and crowding men forward, and his speed
seemed to increase. But by this time <i>Fanning’s</i>
guns were speaking to him in unmistakable language;
after the third shot the hatch opened, a white shirt was
waved, and the whole crew came on deck holding up
their hands.</p>

<div id="if_i_291" class="figcenter" style="width: 429px;">
  <img src="images/i_291.jpg" width="429" height="600" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">‘The submarine suddenly broke surface.’</div></div>

<p>It was now 4.28; the fight had taken no more than
eighteen minutes from first to last, and ten minutes
later the U-boat sank. Her crew had opened the sea
valves and nearly paid the penalty, for they were all
in the water before they could be got off to the destroyer,
and one who could not swim was rescued by two
chivalrous Americans. They jumped into the dark,
cold sea for him, forgetting all about the German rules
of war, and were disappointed when he died on deck.</p>

<p>The account given by the survivors was full of
interest. They were forty-one in number, including
a captain-lieutenant, a first-lieutenant, a lieutenant
and a chief-engineer. The boat had come straight
from her base for the express purpose of attacking this
particular convoy, and had been lying in wait for two
days, paying no attention to any other ships. She
carried twelve torpedoes, and she carries them still,
for not one had been fired when she went down. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_291">291</a><a class="hidev" id="Page_292">292</a></span>
first depth-charge from <i>Fanning</i> had been practically
a direct hit; it had wrecked her motors, diving gear,
and oil leads, and sent her diving entirely out of control
to a depth of 200 feet. The commanding officer thought
at first that he would never be able to stop her, and that
she would go on until the deep-sea pressure burst her
sides in. He had only one possible course&mdash;he blew
out all his four water-ballast tanks at once. This
stopped the dive but brought the boat back to the
surface with a rush and made her unmanageable. One
witness in the destroyers says that she ‘leaped clear of
the water like a breaching whale.’ It was then that
<i>Nicholson</i> overtook her and dropped the second depth-charge;
but even without this the end was inevitable,
for in her porpoise-like gambols she could have been
shot or rammed with certainty. Given a sufficient
supply of patrol boats and depth-charges in the submarine
chase there will be but few and evil days for the
hunted. The American naval authorities have grasped
this truth at once and founded a building policy upon
it. The boats will be provided in any number, and if
they are handled as the <i>Fanning</i> and <i>Nicholson</i> were
handled, the U-boat will spend her short life in dodging
a perpetual bombardment.</p>

<p>That the end of the pirate, when it does come, is
terrible, may easily be conjectured, but probably no
imagination could give any idea of the actual experience.
There is, however, in existence a narrative, compiled
by a neutral from the evidence of two Germans who
survived, by an extraordinary chance, the destruction
of their ship. These men were among the crew of a
U-boat of the largest and newest type, one of the last
to come out of Zeebrugge before the harbour was bottled<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_293">293</a></span>
up by the <i>Intrepid</i> and <i>Iphigenia</i>. She had not gone
far from port when she hit a mine and exploded it.
The shock was severe, but did not at once appear to
be fatal. The electric switches were thrown out of
position, the lights in some compartments went out,
and the vessel began to sink rapidly by the stern;
but the lighting did not take long to restore, and the
crew were immediately ordered to trim the boat by
making a combined rush forward. This manœuvre
was successful in bringing her to an even keel, but by
no effort could she be induced to rise to the surface.</p>

<p>Now began the terror; the plating of the ship had
been shaken and forced apart by the explosion; water
was pouring in; the leaks were rapidly enlarging, and
all attempts to stop them failed. In very few minutes
the boat would be filled either with water or with
chlorine gas from the batteries. It was hardly possible
to escape from the death-trap; but there was one desperate
chance, if the conning-tower and forward hatches
could be forced open against the pressure of the sea.</p>

<p>The commanding officer and the chief engineer
entered the conning-tower and ordered their men to
open one of the forward hatches. If this could be
done, though the crew would have little hope of pushing
their way up through the incoming torrent, the air-pressure
inside the boat would be so greatly increased
that the officers would be probably enabled to open the
conning-tower and escape. But the outside pressure
was too great for the hatch to be moved. The most
violent efforts were made, the men working in relays
and using their strength desperately, while their companions
urged them on with terrible cries. Meantime
it was becoming more and more difficult to breathe;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_294">294</a></span>
the salt water was penetrating the batteries and giving
off chlorine gas. The stern of the vessel was now fully
flooded and the internal air pressure was rapidly
increasing as the free space grew less. The moment
of suffocation was near. But the hatch could not be
raised.</p>

<p>At this point, some of the crew lost control and
behaved like madmen. They crammed cotton waste
into their ears and nostrils, and plunged beneath the
water, which was now knee-deep. One man turned his
revolver upon himself; it missed fire; he hurled it from
him and plunged after his comrades. One, who still
kept his head, with a final effort forced open one of the
torpedo tubes and let in the water to end the struggle
one way or another. Hope returned for a moment.
The internal air pressure increased to such a pitch
that the conning-tower and forward hatch could both
be opened. Officers and men sprang and fought their
way upwards through the inrush.</p>

<p>Perhaps twenty in all made their way out of the
ship; but it was only passing from one death to
another. Human lungs are not adapted for the
sudden change from a deep-sea pressure to surface
conditions. The shrieks of these unfortunate men
were heard by a trawler which happened to be
passing near; but before she could reach them all
were dead but two, and those two were broken men,
bleeding from the lungs and crushed in spirit. They
had digged a cruel pit and fallen into the midst of it
themselves.</p>

<h2 class="vspace"><a id="CHAPTER_XVII"></a>CHAPTER XVII<br />

<span class="subhead">ZEEBRUGGE AND OSTEND</span></h2>
</div>

<p>We have long been regretting that the work and the
fame of our Submarine Service are for the most part
hushed to a kind of undertone. We cannot speak of
them as we wish, lest the enemy should overhear and
profit by information which he is unable to get for
himself. But there are victories that cannot be concealed&mdash;blows
which must and will reverberate, now
and for ages to come. The work of the Navy at Ostend
and Zeebrugge may openly be spoken of as it deserves.
And this is fortunate; for nations, like men, ‘live by
admiration, hope and love,’ and admiration is not
the least powerful of the three elements. The double
attack of St. George’s Day achieved not only a
diminution of the enemy’s strength, but an increase
of our own. All over the world we heard it hailed as a
great feat of arms, and a proof of mastery; even our
own hearts were stronger for being so vividly reminded
that our seamen are what they have always been&mdash;the
greatest fighting men alive.</p>

<p>The very conception of this attack was in itself
conclusive evidence of a high heroic spirit. The enterprise
was not a wild-cat scheme, it was both possible
and useful, but it was one from which no man or officer
could expect to return. It was planned in November<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_296">296</a></span>
1917, a month in which the long and splendid work
of our anti-submarine division was rapidly advancing
to success. The imagination of the Service rose with
the rising tide, and it was determined that the pirates
should be not only hunted down at sea, but harried
and blocked in their principal submarine sally-ports.</p>

<p>These ports had, during the past two years, become
more and more important to the U-boat campaign,
and had therefore been more and more strongly guarded
and fortified against attack. The section of coast
upon which they lie had a system of defensive batteries,
which included no less than 120 heavy guns, some of
them of 15-inch calibre. A battery of these was
upon the Mole at Zeebrugge&mdash;a solid stone breakwater
more than a mile long, which contained also a railway
terminus, a seaplane station, huge sheds for personnel
and material, and, at the extreme seaward end, a
lighthouse with searchlight and range-finder. An
attacking force must reckon with a large number of
defenders upon the Mole alone, besides the batteries
and reinforcements on shore, and the destroyers and
other ships in the harbour. But the attack on the
Mole was an indispensable part of the enterprise; for
the enemy’s attention must be diverted from the
block-ships, which were to arrive during the fight and
sink themselves in the mouth of the canal. And in
order to deal satisfactorily with the Mole, it must be
cut off from the reinforcements on shore by the
destruction of the railway viaduct which formed the
landward end of it.</p>

<p>That was not all. The main difficulty of the plan
was the management of the approach and return of the
expedition. The conditions were extremely severe.
First, the attacking force must effect a complete surprise<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_297">297</a></span>
and reach the Mole before the guns of the defence could
be brought to bear upon them. The enemy searchlights
must therefore be put out of action, as far as
possible, by an artificial fog or smoke-screen; but again,
this must not be dense enough to obscure the approach
entirely. Secondly, the work must be done in very
short time, and to the minute; for though the attack
might be a surprise, the return voyage must be made
under fire. The shore batteries were known to have a
destructive range of sixteen miles; to clear out of the
danger zone would take the flotilla two hours, and
daylight would begin by 3.30 <span class="smcap smaller">A.M.</span> It was, therefore,
necessary to leave the Mole by 1.30; and as, for similar
reasons, it was impossible to arrive before midnight, an
hour and a half was all that the time-table could allow
for fighting, blocking, and getting away again. To do
things as exactly as this, a night must be chosen when
wind, weather and tide would all be favourable. We
need not be surprised at hearing that the expedition had
twice before started and been compelled to return without
reaching its objective&mdash;once it was actually within
fifteen miles of the Mole&mdash;but fortunately the Germans,
having no efficient patrol at sea, got no hint of what was
being planned; and in the end were so completely taken
by surprise, that some of their guns when captured
had not even had the covers removed from them!</p>

<p>The attack was to be conducted by Vice-Admiral
Roger Keyes, commanding at Dover. The force employed
was a large and composite one which required
masterly handling. The Ostend expedition was a
comparatively simple affair; but for Zeebrugge there
were needed, besides the principal ships, a fleet of
smoke-boats for making fog, motor launches for showing
flares and bringing off men in difficulties, monitors<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_298">298</a></span>
for bombarding the batteries, and destroyers for looking
after the enemy ships lying in harbour, besides a
submarine of which we shall hear more presently. The
landing on the Mole was to be made from <i>Vindictive</i>,
an old light cruiser of 5720 tons, and she was to be
accompanied by two old Mersey ferry-boats, <i>Daffodil</i>
and <i>Iris</i>, with storming and demolition parties. The
three destroyers were <i>North Star</i> (Lieut.-Commander
K.&nbsp;C. Helyar), <i>Phœbe</i> (Lieut.-Commander H.&nbsp;E. Gore-Langton),
and <i>Warwick</i>, in which the Admiral himself
was flying his flag for the occasion.</p>

<p>It need not be said, except for the pleasure of saying
it, that the name of every officer present is worth
remembering. Those who died, gave their lives to
secure a victory as effective and gallant as any recorded,
even in our naval history. Those who returned are
marked men, to whom their country will never look
in vain for sound and brilliant service. It is an inspiring
thought that while their action was unique,
they themselves were not. The British Navy is full
of such men, and we may jostle them in the corridors
of the Admiralty every day in the year. Anyone who
happened to be near Room 24 on the morning of Monday,
April 22, might have seen two officers come out who
bore no sign of a destiny more heroic than the rest.
Yet they were, in fact, Captain Alfred Carpenter, who
had been selected to command <i>Vindictive</i>, and Wing-Commander
Brock, who was to create the magic fog,
and whose mysterious fate is one of the most heroic
and moving episodes of the fight.</p>

<p>To Captain Carpenter we owe the best account
yet given of the expedition. If we read the main
portion of it, and supplement it with a few notes, we
shall get as near to realising the achievement as anyone<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_299">299</a></span>
without experience or expert knowledge can do. ‘At
last,’ he says, ‘the opportunity we had waited for
so long arose, and everybody started off in the highest
spirits, and with no other thought than to make the
very greatest success of the operation. Fate was very
kind to us on the whole, and everything went well&mdash;almost
as per schedule. The various phases depended
on accurate timing of the work of the various units.
The smoke-screen craft and the fast motor-boats, at
given intervals, rushed on ahead at full speed, laid their
smoke-screens, attacked enemy vessels with torpedoes,
and generally cleared the way for the main force, in
addition to hiding the approach of the latter from
the shore batteries. Meanwhile a heavy bombardment
was being carried out by our monitors, and the sound
of their firing, as we approached, was one of the most
heartening things that I can remember. On arriving
at a certain point some considerable distance from
shore, the forces parted, some going to Zeebrugge and
some to Ostend, the idea being that the forces should
arrive at the two places simultaneously, so that communication
from one place to the other could not be
used as a warning in either case. Precisely at midnight
(the scheduled time) the main force arrived at Zeebrugge
and two of the block-ships arrived at Ostend. The
Admiral’s signal before going into action was “St
George for England!” and the reply from <i>Vindictive</i>
was “May we give the Dragon’s tail a damned good
twist!”</p>

<blockquote>

<p>‘At midnight we steamed through a very thick
smoke-screen. German star shells were lighting up
the whole place almost like daylight, and one had an
extraordinary naked feeling when one saw how exposed
we were, although it was in the middle of the night.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_300">300</a></span>
On emerging from the smoke-screen the end of the
Mole, where the lighthouse is, was seen close ahead,
distant about 400 yards. The ship was turned immediately
to go alongside, and increased to full speed
so as to get there as fast as possible. We had decided
not to open fire from the ship until they opened fire on
us, so that we might remain unobserved till the last
possible moment. A battery of five or six guns on the
Mole began firing at us almost immediately, from a
range of about 300 yards, and every gun on the <i>Vindictive</i>
that would bear fired at them as hard as it
could. (Ours were 6-inch guns and 12-pounders.)</p>

<p>‘In less than five minutes the ship was alongside the
Mole, and efforts were made to grapple the Mole, so as
to keep the ship in place. The <i>Iris</i> was ahead. The
<i>Daffodil</i>, which was following close astern, came up and
in the most gallant manner placed her bow against
the <i>Vindictive</i> and pushed the <i>Vindictive</i> sideways, until
she was close alongside the Mole. There was a very
heavy swell against the Mole; the ships were rolling
about, and this made the work of securing to the Mole
exceedingly difficult.’</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Vindictive</i> was specially fitted along the port side
with a high false deck, from which ran eighteen brows
or gangways, by which the storming parties were to
land. The men were standing ready, but before the
word was given a shell killed Colonel Bertram Elliot
of the Marines, and Captain Henry Halahan (who was
commanding the blue-jackets) fell to machine-gun fire.
But no losses could stop the stormers.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>‘When the brows were run out from the <i>Vindictive</i>,
the men at once climbed out along them. It was an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_301">301</a></span>
extremely perilous task, in view of the fact that the
ends of the brows at one moment were from eight to
ten feet above the wall, and the next moment were
crashing on the wall as the ship rolled. The way in
which the men got over those brows was almost super-human.
I expected every moment to see them falling
off between the Mole and the ship&mdash;at least a 30-feet drop&mdash;and
being crushed by the ship against the wall.
But not a man fell&mdash;their agility was wonderful. It
was not a case of seamen running barefoot along the
deck of a rolling ship; the men were carrying heavy
accoutrements, bombs, Lewis guns and other articles,
and their path lay along a narrow and extremely unsteady
plank. (Of these plank brows only two were
uninjured by the enemy’s fire; the rest were riddled.)
They never hesitated; they went along the brows,
and onto the Mole with the utmost possible speed.
Within a few minutes three to four hundred had been
landed, and under cover of a barrage put down on the
Mole by Stokes guns and howitzer fire from the ships,
they fought their way along.</p>

<p>‘Comparatively few of the German guns were able
to hit the hull of the ship, as it was behind the protection
of the wall. Safety, in fact, depended on how near
you could get to the enemy guns, instead of how far
away. While the hull was guarded, the upper works
of the ship&mdash;the funnels, masts, ventilators and bridge&mdash;were
showing above the wall, and upon these a large
number of German guns appeared to be concentrated.
Many of our casualties were caused by splinters coming
down from the upper works. (One shell burst in the
Stokes battery, another destroyed the flame-throwing
house, and a third killed every man in the fighting top
except one&mdash;Sergeant Finch, who was badly wounded,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_302">302</a></span>
but kept his machine-gun going and won the V.C. for
it.) If it had not been for the <i>Daffodil</i> continuing to
push the ship in towards the wall throughout the
operation, none of the men who went on the Mole
would ever have got back again.’</p></blockquote>

<p>But <i>Daffodil’s</i> men jumped across to <i>Vindictive</i>,
and so joined the storming party. <i>Iris</i>, in the meantime,
was trying to grapple the Mole ahead of <i>Vindictive</i>;
but her grapnels were not large enough to span the
parapet, and two most gallant officers&mdash;Lieut.-Commander
Bradford and Lieut. Hawkins&mdash;who climbed
up and sat astride the parapet trying to make them
fast, were both shot and fell between the ship and the
wall. Commander Valentine Gibbs had both legs shot
away. He came out of action with his ship, but died
next morning. His place on the bridge was taken by
Lieutenant Spencer, R.N.R., who was already wounded,
but refused to be relieved. Finally a single big shell
came down through the upper deck and burst among some
marines who were waiting their turn for the gangways.
Out of 56 only 7 survived, and they were all wounded.
Altogether <i>Iris</i> lost 8 officers and 69 men killed, and
3 officers and 102 men wounded. But the parapet
was stormed all right, and the Germans under it put
up no resistance except intense and unremitting gunfire.
Some of them took refuge in a destroyer, and were
sent to the bottom with her by a successful bombing
attack from the parapet.</p>

<p>After some fifteen minutes of this work the batteries
on the Mole were silenced, the dugouts cleaned out,
and the whole range of hangars and store sheds set
blazing, or blown to ruins with dynamite. Then came
the first great moment of triumph. ‘A quarter of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_303">303</a></span>
an hour after the <i>Vindictive</i> took her position, a tremendous
explosion was seen at the shore end of the
Mole. We then knew that our submarine (the old
C.&nbsp;3, who had certainly reached the age for retiring) had
managed to get herself in between the piles of the
(railway) viaduct connecting the Mole with the shore,
and had blown herself up. She carried several tons
of high explosive (the equivalent of over 40 good
mines) and the effect of her action was effectually to
cut off the Mole from the land. Before the explosion
the crew of the submarine, which comprised some half-dozen
officers and men (under command of Lieutenant
R.&nbsp;D. Sandford, R.N.), got away in a very small motor
skiff, which lost its propeller and had to be pulled
with (a single pair of) paddles against a heavy tide and
under machine-gun fire from a range which could be
reckoned only in feet. Most of the crew were wounded,
but the tiny boat was picked up by a steam pinnace
(commanded by Lieut.-Commander Sandford, who
rescued his brother and the other five salamanders
when they had struggled only 200 yards away from the
point of explosion). It is possible that the Germans
who saw the submarine coming in under the play of
their searchlights, thought that her object was to
attack the vessels within the Mole, and that she thought
it feasible to get through the viaduct to do this. Their
neglect to stop the submarine as she approached could
only be put down to the fact that they knew she could
not get through owing to the large amount of interlacing
between the piles, and that they really believed
they were catching her! A large number of Germans
were actually on the viaduct, a few feet above the
submarine, and were firing at her with machine-guns.
I think it can safely be said that everyone of those<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_304">304</a></span>
Germans went up with the viaduct. The cheer raised
by my men in the <i>Vindictive</i> when they saw the terrific
explosion, was one of the finest things I ever heard.
Many of the men were severely wounded&mdash;some had
three and even four wounds&mdash;but they had no thought
except for the success of the operation. (They cheered
their captain as he went round the decks and kept
asking, “Have we won?”&mdash;just as if it had been a
football match.)</p>

<p>‘About twenty-five minutes after the <i>Vindictive</i>
got alongside (and ten minutes after the explosion
of C.&nbsp;3), the block-ships were seen rounding the lighthouse
and heading for the canal entrance. It was then
realised on board the <i>Iris</i>, <i>Daffodil</i> and <i>Vindictive</i> that
their work had been accomplished. The block-ships
came under very heavy fire immediately they rounded
the end of the Mole. Most of the fire, it appears, was
concentrated on the leading ship, the <i>Thetis</i> (Commander
R.&nbsp;S. Sneyd). She ran aground off the entrance
to the canal, on the edge of the channel, and was sunk,
as approximately as possible, across the channel itself,
thus forming an obstruction to the passage of the
German vessels.’ She was coming in in grand style,
but had the bad luck to catch her propeller in the
defence nets and became a target; but she did fine
work even then, signalling to her sister ships and
enabling them to avoid the nets. And she may give
quite as much trouble to the enemy yet as the other
two, for she lies right in the channel, which must always
be kept free from silt if even the outer harbour is to
be used.</p>

  <div class="caption">‘A tremendous explosion was seen at the shore end of the Mole.’</div></div>

<p>‘This co-operation between the three block-ships,
carried out under extremely heavy fire, was one of the
finest things in the operation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_305">305</a><a class="hidev" id="Page_306">306</a></span>
‘The second and third ships, the <i>Intrepid</i> (Lieutenant
Stuart Bonham-Carter) and <i>Iphigenia</i> (Lieutenant E.&nbsp;W.
Billyard-Leake), both went straight through the canal
entrance until they actually reached a point some
two or three hundred yards inside the shore lines, and
behind some of the German batteries. It really seems
very wonderful. How the crews of the two ships
ever got away is almost beyond imagination.’ Lieutenant
Bonham-Carter, after running <i>Intrepid</i> into the
canal bank, ordered his crew away in the boats, and
blew her up himself. He then escaped on a Carley
float, a kind of patent buoy which lights a flare when
it takes the water. Very fortunately, <i>Intrepid</i> was
still smoking and the smoke partially hid both him
and his flare. He was picked up by a motor launch
(Lieutenant Deane, R.N.V.R.) which had actually
gone inshore to take off another officer who had swum
to the bank, and brought away both together. <i>Iphigenia</i>,
too, after ramming a dredger and carrying away
a barge with her up the canal, was even more successfully
placed across the channel and blown up with
her engines still going, to ensure her sticking her nose
fast in the mud. Her crew escaped, some in the motor
launches and some in their own boats, rowing for
miles out to sea before they were picked up by the
destroyers.</p>

<p>‘The situation, rather more than an hour after the
<i>Vindictive</i> got alongside, was this: The block-ships had
passed in, had come to the end of their run, and had
done their work. The viaduct was blown up and the
Mole had been stormed.’ Even the lighthouse had
been sacked, for Wing-Commander Brock had announced
before starting that after seeing to the
smoke-screen work, his first objective would be the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_307">307</a></span>
range-finding apparatus which he knew was up in the
lighthouse top. He carried out his intentions. He
was seen going into the lighthouse, and coming out
again laden with an armful of stuff; then charging
a gun single-handed; and, last of all, lying desperately
wounded under the parapet wall of the Mole. This
was only reported afterwards, and his fate is unknown
to this day. If he died, he died as he would have
wished, for he was a big man with a big heart, and did
his fighting gladly. ‘Nothing but a useless sacrifice
of life could have followed if the three boarding vessels
had remained by the Mole any longer. The signal to
withdraw was therefore given, and the ships got away
under cover of the smoke-screens as quickly as they
could. The signal was given by siren, but the noise
of the guns was so loud that it had to be repeated many
times. Twenty minutes passed before it was definitely
reported that there was nobody left on the Mole who
could possibly get on board the withdrawing ships.</p>

<p>‘All three ships got away from the wall; they went
at full speed and were followed all the way along their
course by salvos from the German guns. Shells
seemed to fall all round the ships without actually
hitting them. The gunners apparently had our speed
but not our range, and with remarkable regularity
the salvos plopped into the sea behind us. In a
short time the ships were clear of imminent danger,
owing to the large amount of smoke which they had
left behind them.’ Two of the three destroyers also
got away safely; the third, <i>North Star</i>, was sunk by
gunfire near the block-ships but her crew were brought
off by <i>Phœbe</i>. Her loss was balanced by that of the
German destroyer, sunk by bombs under the inner wall
of the Mole. Of our motor-launches (under command<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_308">308</a></span>
of Captain R. Collins), many of which performed feats
of incredible audacity at point-blank range, all returned
but two.</p>

<p>‘There is no doubt about the complete success of
the enterprise. Photographs taken by our flying-men
show that two of the block-ships are in the mouth
of the Bruges Canal, well inside the shore line, and
lying diagonally across the channel. The third is
outside the canal mouth, blocking the greater part of
the channel across the harbour. An officer assured
me that the bottoms having been blown out of the
ships, they are now simply great solid masses of concrete.
Blasting, even if it could be attempted without
risk to the surroundings (<i>e.g.</i>, the walls of the canal and
docks) would only divide one solid mass into several
masses, just as obstructive as the whole. Moreover,
owing to the shallowness of most of the harbour area,
every tide will cause sand to silt up about the obstacles
and make their removal more difficult. The photographs
reveal a clean break in the viaduct at the landward
end of the Mole. They also show that the Germans
have tried to bridge the gap by planking.’ But planking
will hardly carry the railway; and as for the block-ships,
they were still in position three months later,
with dredging parties at work who only offered an
excellent target to the bombs of our seaplanes.</p>

<p>During the attack at Zeebrugge the wind changed
and blew the smoke off shore. This helped us in the
end by enabling the ships to cover their retirement
with a thick screen of miscellaneous smoke; but at
Ostend it caused a partial failure of the blocking operations.
Commodore Hubert Lynes, who commanded
this little expedition, successfully laid his smoke-screen,
and sent in his motor-boats behind it to light up the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_309">309</a></span>
ends of the two wooden piers with flares, visible to
our ships but not to the enemy. He then sent in two
old cruisers, <i>Sirius</i> and <i>Brilliant</i>, which were to be sunk
between the piers. But the moment the wind changed,
the enemy, seeing the flares, at once extinguished them,
sinking the motor-boats by gunfire, and the block-ships
were no longer able to find the entrance. They
ran aground about 2000 yards to the east of the piers
and were there blown up. Their crews were taken off
under heavy fire in motor-launches commanded by
Lieutenant K.&nbsp;R. Hoare, R.N.V.R., and Lieutenant
R. Bourke, R.N.V.R.</p>

<p>One object had been accomplished&mdash;the Ostend
garrison had been thoroughly distracted from giving
any warning or assistance to Zeebrugge; but the
block-ships had only made the harbour entrance
dangerous&mdash;they had not closed it. There was no doubt
on either side that the attempt would be renewed.
Our men were all ready and eager for a fight to a
finish; the Germans were quick to take every precaution
possible. They removed the Stroom Bank
buoy, which marked the entrance to the harbour, cut
the wooden piers through, to prevent landing parties
from advancing along them, and tried to keep up a
patrol of the coast with some nine destroyers. But,
in spite of all, they were once more taken by surprise,
and this time they lost the game at Ostend as they had
lost it at Zeebrugge.</p>

<p>The new expedition sailed on May 9 under command,
as before, of Commodore Hubert Lynes. Vice-Admiral
Sir Roger Keyes was also present himself,
in the destroyer <i>Warwick</i>. The flotilla was this time
on a larger scale, and the block-ship (which was entrusted
to Commander Godsal, late of the <i>Brilliant</i>)<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_310">310</a></span>
was none other than the <i>Vindictive</i> herself, and was
to double her glory by a triumphant death.</p>

<p>The night was a perfect one, calm with light airs
from the north, a few faint stars and no moon. The
ships came on in silence; for though the monitors were
already anchored in their firing positions, and the heavy
land batteries towards Nieuport were trained ready
for the bombardment, not a shot was to be fired until
the signal was given for every arm to attack at the
same moment. The whole German front was shrouded
in a delicate haze, like a genuine sea fog, but even
more impenetrable to sight or searchlight. Under
cover of this, Commodore Lynes first took his destroyer
in and laid a burning light-buoy as a mark for the
block-ship. <i>Vindictive</i> followed, and from this point
bore up for another flare, lighted by Lieutenant William
Slayter on the former position of the Stroom Bank
buoy. Four minutes before she arrived there, and
fifteen minutes before she was timed to reach the
harbour mouth, the signal was given for a general
engagement. Instantly the whole force got to work.
Two motor-boats, under Lieutenant Albert Poland
and Lieutenant Darrel Reid, R.N.R., dashed in and
fired their torpedoes at the two wooden pier ends.
The western pier had a machine-gun mounted, and
that too went up in the explosion. Then the seaplanes
began to bomb the town and the monitors were
heard thundering from far out to sea. The German
star shells were useless in the mist, but every gun in
the batteries and land-turrets opened at once, and the
Royal Marine guns on our front replied to them with
flanking fire.</p>

<p>At this moment a real sea fog drifted in and mixed
with the smoke-screen; our destroyers had to keep<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_311">311</a></span>
touch by siren signals, and <i>Vindictive</i> found herself in
danger of missing her mark, like <i>Sirius</i> and <i>Brilliant</i>.
She had a motor-boat escorting her on each side with
huge Dover flares, but the darkness was too dense
even for them. Twice she passed the entrance, and
came back at last to her first position. Then, by a happy
chance, a breeze cleared the fog for a moment and she
saw the piers close to her with the opening dead ahead.
Acting-Lieutenant Guy Cockburn, in his motor-boat,
saw them too; he dashed in under heavy fire and laid
his flare right in the channel; <i>Vindictive</i> went straight
over it and into goal.</p>

<p>The enemy were now blazing at her with everything
they had. A shell hit the after-control and killed
Sub-Lieutenant Angus MacLachlan with all his men.
Machine-gun bullets made the chart-room and bridges
untenable, and Commander Godsal took his officers
into the conning-tower. There, after steaming about
200 yards along between the piers, he left them, and
went outside, calling back to them to order the ship
to be laid bow on to the eastern pier and so swing across
the channel. The order was no sooner given than
a shell struck the conning-tower full. It killed the
Commander outside and stunned Lieutenant Sir John
Alleyne, who was inside with Lieutenant V.&nbsp;A.&nbsp;C.
Crutchley. Lieutenant Crutchley shouted through the
observation slit to the Commander, but, getting no
reply, he coolly went on with the swinging of the ship
by ringing full speed astern with the port engine. But
he soon found that she had ceased to move, so he gave
the order to abandon ship and sink her. The main
charges were accordingly blown by Engineer-Lieut.-Commander
William Bury and the auxiliary charges
by Lieutenant Crutchley himself. <i>Vindictive</i> heaved,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_312">312</a></span>
sank about six feet, and settled on the bottom at an
angle of forty-five degrees across the channel. ‘Her
work was done,’ says the official narrative.</p>

<p>The losses were two officers and six men killed,
two officers and ten men missing, believed killed, and
four officers and eight men wounded. The greater
number of these were hit while leaving the <i>Vindictive</i>.
They were taken off under very heavy machine-gun
fire by motor-launches under Lieutenant Bourke,
R.N.V.R., and Lieutenant Geoffry Drummond, R.N.V.R.
When the latter reached the <i>Warwick</i> his launch
was shot to pieces and unseaworthy, he himself was
severely wounded, his second in command, Lieutenant
Gordon Ross, R.N.V.R., and one seaman, were killed,
and a number of others wounded. Day was breaking
and they were still within easy range of the forts, so
the good ship motor-launch 254 was sunk by a charge
in her engine-room. The triumphant return was made
without even the most distant attempt at interference
by the nine German destroyers. It was a fine chance
for a counterstroke with superior force, but the nine
did not see it. Ostend remained, like Zeebrugge, a
complete British victory.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
